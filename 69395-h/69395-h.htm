<h3>
CREEPING JENNY
</h3>

<p>
Jenny Lane lived in a shabby little
farmhouse on the Back Nippin' Road that led
from Riverboro to Moderation Village.
The house was small and compact and as
neat as wax inside, for there Jenny was
Master of her fate and Captain of her soul.
</p>

<p>
Outside, alas, things were different.
There was only the shell of a former stable;
the shed was tumbling down, and, when rain
descended in anything worse than gentle
showers, Jenny's "indoors" looked like a
syndicate of milk pans, the leaks were so
many and the dripping of water so continuous.
</p>

<p>
It had been that way for three years, ever
since the autumn that her mother had died;
and her father, who had followed his wife
in everything, followed her to the grave a
month later.
</p>

<p>
His last words to his daughter had been:
"I'm sorry to leave you alone, Jenny, but
I'd feel better if only I'd left you shingled.
Your mother and me was laying up and
laying up ever since we got married.  We
bought the house and field, paid off the
mortgage and gave you good schooling.
We are furnished up as well as most o' the
neighbors, but when your mother's health
got slim and my strength begun to fail, we
couldn't seem to get any farther than meat,
drink, and clothes for the three of us.  The
buildings couldn't be kept up, that was the
long and short of it."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know, Father.  Haven't I seen
how hard you tried?"
</p>

<p>
"Now I'm on my death-bed," said the old
man.  "There's money enough in the bank
to buy the shingles, but God knows whether
you can afford to hire a man to put 'em on,
labor's so scarce and so high."
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, Father!  I don't want
your last days troubled with fears about
me and the roof.  I'm twenty-two and I can
earn my living somehow, somewhere!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tisn't so easy to earn your living and
keep your buildings shingled too!" sighed
her father.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe not, but I'll do it, in course of
time!" said Jenny stoutly.  "I've heard
enough, all my life, about shingles; also
about clapboards and paint.  There isn't a
young man in the neighborhood that I'd
want to go to church with, but if one of
them should ever chance to ask me to have
him, I'd say: 'Shingle the house and I'll say
yes!'"
</p>

<p>
The girl's father smiled in spite of his
pain as he whispered: "Don't be too easy
when it comes to bargaining, Jenny!  Stiperlate
first quality cedar shingles, him to buy
'em as well as put 'em on!  You're worth
it!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall never have a chance to 'stiperlate,'"
thought Jenny, as she went to the
kitchen to make gruel; and, as a matter of
fact, although Jenny was good to look upon,
and had an acre of timber land that would
bring in something, fifteen years later, no
lovelorn swain had offered to take her and
her leaky house for better, for worse.
</p>

<p>
Later on there were other reasons why
Jenny had no opportunity to "stiperlate."  The
anxious and dreary months went on
relentlessly after her father's death, when
new misfortunes descended upon her&mdash;an
accident&mdash;unskillful treatment, too long
delayed&mdash;finally, the loss of a foot&mdash;a
crutch&mdash;eternal lameness.  No wonder, as
she dragged herself about the house and
little garden before she had had time to
accustom herself to her infirmity, that
Riverboro sympathetically called her
"Creeping Jenny."  Her nearest neighbor,
Mrs. Day, a widow, lived within easy
walking distance (it seemed longer when you
limped!), and the village itself was only a
quarter of a mile away, so she did not lack
an occasional call, the offer of an errand or
message, and often a drive to church, made
wretched by the difficulty of mounting and
descending the wagon, with the added
mortification of limping into a rear pew.
</p>

<p>
Still she kept things together, sewing,
crocheting, knitting, sending braided and
drawn-in rugs to Boston, selling the butter
from the one cow's milk and the hay from
her eight-acre field.
</p>

<p>
She got "Pollyanna" from the village
library and read it faithfully, but she was
rebellious and it did her no good.  She allowed
to herself grudgingly that if she had lost a
hand instead of a foot she couldn't have
earned her living; but she never got to the
point of being grateful that it was a foot, not
a hand; she was unregenerate and wanted
both.
</p>

<p>
It was late November now, and even at
the end of the month there was a hint of
Indian summer in the air, though a soft
rain had been falling for many hours.  Jenny's
side-door stood open; there was a pale
flicker of sun now and then and she was in
the pantry wondering if she could venture to
take away some of the milk pans that dotted
the kitchen floor, all of them a third full of
drippings from the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
She heard the swinging of the garden gate
and a knock made her take her crutch and
limp to the kitchen door.
</p>

<p>
A good-looking young man, fairly well
clad, with his left sleeve hanging in a strange
sort of stiffness, raised a shabby felt hat
with his right hand and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Is this Miss Jenny Lane?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"They told me at the station you were
minus a man and might have a few days'
work for me."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody in Riverboro is minus a man,
and everybody needs a little help.  There's
plenty to do here, for I live alone, but I have
little money to spend on keeping up the
place."
</p>

<p>
The young man glanced in at the door
with a boyish sort of informality and asked:
"Do you keep a dairy farm?"
</p>

<p>
Jenny laughed outright, and kept on
laughing as she answered: "No wonder you
asked, but I shouldn't set milk on the floor
and it's water in the pans.  It's a water farm!"
</p>

<p>
The laughter was mutual now, and the
audacious youth, moving to the lower step
and glancing upward, said: "I see you're a
little shy on shingles?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a trifle, but I'm long on milk pans!"
</p>

<p>
"They told me you were a first-class
farmer but&mdash;er&mdash;a little handicapped on
outside work."
</p>

<p>
Jenny leaned against the door-frame and
stroked her crutch with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Footicapped would be a better word,"
she said.  "Are you a stranger in Riverboro?
Won't you rest a moment?  Make your way
through the milk pans to the rocking chair.
I do need a little help in getting my winter
wood in."
</p>

<p>
"You'll require a lot of wood unless you
get a tight roof over your head," said the
stranger.  "I'm a Western farmer's son, or
at least I was; but my mother and father
died while I was in France and I'm alone in
the world."
</p>

<p>
"France?" echoed Jenny, with a new
glance in her eye and a new tone in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we'll cut that out!  I landed in
Boston the other day and now I'm just kind
of 'adventuring' till I get my 'peace legs'
on."
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't have come to a worse
place than Riverboro.  There hasn't been
an adventure here in a hundred years."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that!  I've only been
in town half an hour and I've seen a water
farm and a lady that runs it to the Queen's
taste!"
</p>

<p>
Jenny laughed again; the sweetest, most
tuneful laugh in the world; one that she
seldom used nowadays but had kept over
from her long-ago youth.  What a droll
stranger!  And how much more interesting
he would be in the intervals of sawing and
splitting wood, than old George Gibson.
</p>

<p>
"It is too ridiculous that you should
have seen the milk pans and noticed the
shingles.  I am going to have the roof fixed
next spring if I live.  Father saved up
money for the stock but&mdash;but, I had to use
it in a long illness."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!" interrupted the stranger.
"It beats all how that runs through life!
You save up money for shingles and then
you can't get enough more to put 'em on."
</p>

<p>
"I'm nearly ready for the second time,"
Jenny's tone was cheerful and incisive, "but
I don't think I have quite enough to pay for
labor.  Besides, you couldn't, I mean you
wouldn't&mdash;shingle&mdash;could you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I would, and could!  You're strong
on the subjunctive, aren't you?  You've
noticed I'm handicapped (I don't have to
invent a word, it's all right for my case!).
But just you wait and see what I can do
with the substitute presented me by the
U.S.A.!  I'm going to have something more
stylish later on, but I don't believe it will
serve me any better; you see it's only my
left arm!"
</p>

<p>
Jenny stopped her ears.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me you've read 'Pollyanna'
and are glad it isn't your right arm!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I'm glad!  Who wouldn't be?
Who's Pollyanna?"
</p>

<p>
"She's a girl in a book who's always glad
that things aren't any worse."
</p>

<p>
"All right for Polly!  More power to her
elbow!  Now I'm by no means dead broke
and I've got back-pay coming to me from
Washington, when they get 'round to it.
But I want to train myself to work at anything
that comes.  If I can't make good I'll
go to a vocational school, but I want to
harden myself first."
</p>

<p>
"My roof in November would be a good
place for that!" said Jenny contemplatively.
"What wages do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Half what the other men get around
here, because I'm not a skilled worker at
present.  Now if you've got a ladder on the
premises I can get up and tear off the old
shingles while you negotiate for the new
ones.  Going to buy first quality cedars?"
</p>

<p>
Jenny grew red and then white, for her
memory flashed back, and by an odd trick
she remembered her father's injunction to
"stiperlate," a word that was to be used
in far more romantic circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"Can't manage first quality; seconds will
have to do," she said, with some embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"O.K.  I've had nothing but 'seconds' all
my life.  Sometimes I wonder I didn't have
a second wife."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you?"  The question suddenly
popped out of Jenny's mouth without
any warning.
</p>

<p>
"Because I never had a first!  Ha! ha!"  (He
certainly was the most unusual young
man she had ever met and the most informal
on the occasion of a first call.  She felt as if
she'd been to high-school and singing-school
and dancing-school with him!)
</p>

<p>
The stranger rose from his chair.  "I'll
'lime' the 'seconds' for you myself to save
expense.  Want me to get them for you,
because I know a shingle when I see it and
maybe you don't?  I'll go in to the village,
get a boarding-place, and come back after
lunch for a half-day's work."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you&mdash;that will be very kind."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pick up the milk pans and empty
'em for you, first.  Poor old things!  They
don't know they're going out of business!
Let me look at your ladder, please.  A man
that works with a woman's farming implements
ought to carry a big life insurance!"
</p>

<p>
Jenny laughed again, joyously.  Then,
entirely forgetting decorum, she wiped her
eyes with her apron and said, "If I only
knew what your wages were going to be I'd
raise them, you are so funny!  The ladder is
in the shed.  I think it's all right."
</p>

<p>
He looked about the shed in amazement
at its cleanliness and order.  "Holy Moses!"
he thought, "does that little creature sweep
and scrub this place and pile up this wood
and kindling, skipping about on a crutch?
And us great husky lubbers getting 'orders
of merit' for doing our duty by the country.
Wonder if Miss Jenny Lane has had any
medals handed out to her?  She can have
mine when I get well enough acquainted to
give it to her."
</p>

<p>
Jenny followed him out to the shed.
</p>

<p>
"Is the ladder quite safe?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Safe as a meeting-house."
</p>

<p>
"Then, as you go to the village, you'll
see twin boys hanging over the gate at the
next house, Mrs. Day's.  Ask the red-haired,
freckled one (his name is Alfinso) if he'll
come up this afternoon and help you, for
five cents.  He'll hold the ladder, pick up the
shingles or commit any crime if you just tell
him that Jenny'll have fresh doughnuts for
you and him at supper-time.  Don't ask
Alfonso, the dark-haired twin; he doesn't
like work and doesn't like doughnuts."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the stranger, wiping his
hand on a potato sack, "I wasn't in the
Salvation Army belt when they were
distributing doughnuts to the boys and my
mouth is fairly watering for one.  My
name's Rufus Holt, of Lawrence, Kansas."  Here
he held out his hand which Jenny took,
stunned by the suddenness of his action.
"I'm your hired man till this roof is fixed.
You look to me like a grand little boss.  I'll
be back in an hour and I hope I don't get
Alfinso and Alfonso mixed!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Creeping Jenny" has a method all its
own of making its way upward and onward,
silently, smoothly, under and over, betwixt
and between obstacles.  The slender little
green vine climbs, not so much with
strength, as with swiftness and grace, and
accomplishes its growth in a miraculously
short space of time.  You can leave your
garden rake against the barn door some
warm night, and next morning Jenny will
have crept up to the top of the handle,
leaned over and flung down a few little
fragrant blossoms here and there just to
give you a hint of Nature's magic.
</p>

<p>
By a like process and another sort of
magic, Jenny Lane crept into Rufus Holt's
heart, which was a big lonesome one, howling
with emptiness, at the time he began shingling
her house.  They came to know more of
each other as the days went by.  He and she,
with Alfinso, ate luncheon together on the
shed bench so that the day's labor need not
be delayed by a trip to the village for Rufus.
(At least that is what he said, and she said,
and Alfinso said, and Mrs. Day said, and
nobody doubted it but the postmistress.)
</p>

<p>
Alfinso, whose pay had now been increased
to ten cents a day, was the most faithful
of "gooseberries," but even he sometimes
wandered away to the wood-pile to work
on a motor that he was constructing, to be
used in connection with the power of an old
alarm clock.
</p>

<p>
At such times Rufus and Jenny would
talk together before she gathered up the
dishes.  She allowed him a pipe, and when
she attempted to rise and go to the kitchen
he would say: "Take your 'nooning,' Miss
Jenny, same as the rest of us.  The minute
you drop your housework you take out your
needle."
</p>

<p>
"I've had to be busy to keep from thinking,
these last two years," she said, quietly
arranging the knives and forks for clearing
away.  "Now I'm afraid of getting idle, for
what with company at lunch, the sound of
hammer or saw all day, and the smell of
paint all night, it seems as if Boston couldn't
be any gayer than my little house."
</p>

<p>
Rufus liked to watch the dimple come
and go in Jenny's cheek, a dimple that had
enjoyed little use till lately; he also admired
the whiteness of the neck that rose out of
the blue gingham working dress, and the
long eyelashes that too often lay on her
cheek and hid her brown eyes.  He often
tried to say something that would bring a
quick upward glance full of fun or
understanding.  As for his talk, no words can tell
what it was to the girl who had spent hundreds
of long, silent, lonely days, feeling
her youth slipping by, a tragedy without a
single witness.
</p>

<p>
"Where were you last Christmas, Miss
Jenny Wren?" Rufus asked between pipe-puffs,
after lunching gloriously on shoulder-of-mutton
stew.  (He had always called her
Miss Jenny Wren after the first week.)
</p>

<p>
"Here, of course!" she said, smiling.  "I
was born here, lived here and probably shall
die here.  All the rooms but the kitchen had
icicles hanging from the ceilings and
window-frames.  The parlor looked like that famous
cave in Kentucky with the stalactites in the
roof.  There had been a blizzard on the
twenty-third and I couldn't go to the church
Christmas tree.  It was nearly as bad the
Christmas before.  I've never celebrated
Christmas day, except to plant a little
hemlock twig in a flower pot and hang Mother's
and Father's pictures on it."
</p>

<p>
"Jehosaphat!" ejaculated Rufus.  "It
wasn't so bad as that in the trenches where
I was.  Plenty of company&mdash;of one sort and
another; I declare women always have the
hardest of it in this old world somehow.
Trenches and over-the-tops were exciting
compared to what you've gone through.
They were <i>life</i>!  A man generally has life and
adventure with his hard knocks; but women
are always saving, scrimping, doing without,
suffering, nursing, burying, paying other
people's debts and bearing other people's
burdens.  Rotten luck, being a woman!"
and he knocked the ashes from his pipe
furiously.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought of it that way," said
Jenny serenely.  "I have my one burden,
but it's my own, nobody else's!"
</p>

<p>
"Say, if I'm hereabouts to help, suppose
you give a kind of a housewarming this
year; some sort of a make-shift Christmas
and show off the shingles!  Hey?"
</p>

<p>
"Who would come?" cried Jenny.  "And
how could I compete with the church
Christmas?  Besides you are going to
Boston."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't decided about Boston yet."  (Jenny's
heart leaped into her mouth and
stopped her breath.)  "As for the company,
Mrs. Day could come, Alfinso and Alfonso
(hateful little beggar, Alfonso!), Mrs. Strout,
who boards me; and there's the station
master that advised me to come to you for a
job, and the man I bought the shingles of,
and the storekeeper we owe for nails&mdash;that's
quite a good crowd!  You put in a
few lady friends and I believe we could
frame up a party that would make Boston
look dull.  What's the matter with the
parson?  Why couldn't he come?  You're in
his parish, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
Jenny swayed to and fro with mirth.
The point of view was so fresh, so young, so
unlike Riverboro.  "You don't know how
funny you are!" she exclaimed.  "The
minister calls twice a year, but always in
summer."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to make it once and come
Christmas Eve!" said Rufus, imperturbably.
"Tell him your leaks are stopped and you'll
show him a wounded soldier who did the
shingling.  'Feature' me, don't you know?
Tell him you'll have my Medal of Honor on
the marble-top table."
</p>

<p>
"You've never shown it to me," said
Jenny, softly.
</p>

<p>
"It's in Boston with my best clothes.
Besides I've told you all about it.  There
happened to be a lot of fellows about when
I was up against a hard job and they told on
me.  The boys didn't all have that luck or
the U.S.A. couldn't have turned out medals
enough to go around....  Now it's time to
work again.  You think about that Christmas
party before I buy my ticket to Boston.
I'm going to patch up that bad place by the
chimney," and Rufus went out the shed
door and mounted the ladder.
</p>

<p>
Oh! the terrors of that high ladder and
that sloping roof to Jenny, from the very
beginning!  With a white, knit cape over her
shoulders and a white scarf tied round her
head, she used to limp to some unseen point
of vantage and watch Rufus with her heart
in her mouth, lest he should slip and lose his
hold.  Sometimes he would catch her at her
post, and looking down, think that her face
looked like a love-apple, all pinky red and
creamy white.  And the warm glow of having
some one down below caring a little whether
he slipped&mdash;he, Rufus Holt, a down-and-outer!
</p>

<p>
He never did make a misstep, for he was a
very demon of ingenuity and skill in using
his one arm.
</p>

<p>
"Brave, clever, good, big-hearted!" sang
Jenny's heart from the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Plucky, cheery, sweet and sound!" sang
the heart of Rufus from the roof&mdash;but
neither of them said anything in words.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Day said considerable, but she liked
Jenny Lane and stood up for her when the
postmistress said there was more in that
shingling business than met the eye.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see anything wrong in it,"
Mrs. Day maintained stoutly.  "Jenny's roof
would have fallen in on her if she hadn't
shingled this fall.  It looks like Providence
to me."
</p>

<p>
"He's so slow at it that it looks like
courting to me," observed the postmistress while
scanning the morning's postcards to see if
anything interesting was likely to happen
in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
"Alfinso thinks the world of Mr. Holt,
and he's getting ten cents a day now.  It's
true Alfonso takes three of it away from him
every night.  He says five is due to him
because he's a twin, but he only takes three
cents because he don't do any work."
</p>

<p>
"Alfonso's goin' to make a good business
man when he grows up," said the post-mistress.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was half-past four in the afternoon, but
in the short December days it was nearly as
dark as midnight.
</p>

<p>
A cheerful fire snapped in Jenny's highly
polished kitchen stove.  The yellow-painted
floor with its braided rugs reflected the light
of the kerosene lamp, the cat was asleep in
the rocking-chair with the cretonne cushion,
and Jenny sat by the table making out a
crochet pattern from a magazine in front of
her.  She had changed into her afternoon
dress of brown cashmere with pongee collar
and cuffs and apron, so that she looked
more than ever like Jenny Wren, Rufus Holt
thought, as he came in from the tool-house
with a lantern.
</p>

<p>
"Alfinso is splitting and piling his
kindling," he said.  "He wants me to wait and
go along home with him.  Alfonso has told
him there's a ghost between here and the
corner.  Gracious!  Can any parlor in the
world beat a kitchen for comfort when it's
rigged out and kept like yours!  (No, puss,
I wouldn't have you move for the world,
even if you offered to!  I'll take a wooden
chair!)"
</p>

<p>
"The cat is spoiled," said Jenny, "and
you look tired.  You ought not to be doing
rough work or you won't get to be yourself
again."
</p>

<p>
"I'm myself, right enough; in fact I never
was so much myself since I was born.  I'm
not tired; the sight of you and this kitchen
rests me clean through to the bone."
</p>

<p>
Jenny changed color, but studied the
crochet pattern with renewed care.
</p>

<p>
"I don't miss my arm any more," Rufus
continued, playing with her thread.  "I've
learned to do without it.  I never thought I
should, but I have, with a little help from a
lady friend.  I never was bitter about it like
some.  When you come to think of it, Miss
Jenny Wren, it's wonderful how Almighty
God has given us two of a kind in most
things&mdash;on the outside, anyway.  As to the
inside furniture, the doctors have shown us
how to get along without most of that.  If
we'd been started out with one eye, one ear,
one arm and one leg, where would we have
been nowadays?"
</p>

<p>
"We've only one nose and one mouth,"
objected Jenny.
</p>

<p>
"And how would we have looked with
two?" laughed Rufus.  "But that's not to
the point.  The house is finished, Jenny
Wren, and what would you think of buying
a few second-hand boards and letting me
make the cow-shed more comfortable for
winter?"
</p>

<p>
This moment had to come.  Jenny had
been dreading it for days.  There was a
pause, then: "I'm going to sell the cow,"
she stammered.
</p>

<p>
Rufus looked surprised.  "Are you troubled
about the price of feed, or afraid the
winter work will be too much for you?
That's why I'd like to make a better place
for her and patch up the piece of shed you
have to walk through to get to her&mdash;after
I leave.  It's a wonderful season but it's the
eighteenth of December and snow must be
coming along soon."
</p>

<p>
There was another moment of silence,
then Jenny spoke recklessly.  "You see,
Mr. Holt, we've gone on from one thing to
another for three weeks, because the leaky
roof ruined the house in so many ways,
and there's never been a man to help, since
father died.  We've patched the flooring,
put in new door-sills and weather-strips on
the windows, papered the sitting-room and
plastered the kitchen ceiling&mdash;and all the
time I've known I was going too far.  I paid
you fifteen dollars the first week, but it
wasn't half what you earned and you gave
me back three for lunches.  Then you
wouldn't take the last two weeks' wages
because I was buying bricks and lumber
and you said we could settle up when the
work was finished....  I can't let it run on,
Mr. Holt, I can't!  I'm not in want; I've
something in the bank and my hayfield
more than pays for my winter fuel; but I
have to be careful, and the house is so nice
and cozy now it would be self-indulgent to
do more.  I'd better sell the cow.  You're
as kind and generous as you can be, but you
are a stranger after all, and I have no claim
on you."
</p>

<p>
Rufus gave her a long, searching look.
</p>

<p>
"You honestly feel I'm a stranger, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I&mdash;I don't exactly <i>feel</i> that you
are, I only <i>know</i> it.  My mind tells me so."
</p>

<p>
"It's funny!" said Rufus.  "Now&mdash;I
feel like a partner, not a stranger."
</p>

<p>
Jenny clutched at the saving word.
"You have been the best of partners,"
she acknowledged, straightforwardly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  Not the best!  I'm capable of
being a heap better partner than I have
been.  Now stop crocheting, listen to me,
and don't speak till I get through....  In
the first place, do you like me?"
</p>

<p>
Jenny flared at this.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask a question like that?
You know that nobody could help liking
you!  You know you're as sunshiny and
thoughtful as you can be, and as for being
interesting and funny and unlike anybody
else in the world, you know well enough
you're that; so why do you ask such foolish
questions only to hear yourself praised?"
</p>

<p>
Rufus made a sudden movement and
then subsided again into his chair.
</p>

<p>
"That's satisfactory, so far as it goes,"
he said calmly, "though it doesn't go
far enough to suit me.  There are things
I've got to say to you, and when they're
over, we need never speak of them again.  I
haven't any home, nor any people but a
married brother in Kansas, whose wife and
four children I've never seen.  He always
worked the farm and it fell to him, as was
right.  I got a little money from my father,
earned more at my trade in Chicago and
saved it.  Then I went across with the other
boys.  You don't really know anything about
me except what I tell you, but I've got a
clean record to show the neighbors, and I
swear to God there's nothing wrong with
me except that I've got one arm instead of
two.  When I came down this road from the
station three weeks ago I took a good look
at you, skimming around with your crutch,
and swinging your right foot off the ground."
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" cried Jenny, covering her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Rufus put his big hand over her little ones
and wiped the tears away with her crochet
work.  "I've got to show how I feel about
you, and then I'll ask what you think of
me," he explained.  "I said to myself that
day: 'Here's a chance to help somebody
that's had to bear what I have.'  They told
me at the station you needed some work
done, so I just plunged in, made good, and
got the job.  But I had no idea of falling in
love with you, Jenny; that's your fault, not
mine.  I want to marry you, but I don't
know how you feel about it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to be pitied and married
just to be helped," said Jenny stubbornly.
"After my accident I just made up my mind
I would never marry."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Rufus.
</p>

<p>
"You know why," Jenny answered.
</p>

<p>
"Then the reason you don't want to
marry me shows me that I had no right to
ask you, isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't; it's different with a woman.
Besides, I do want to marry you, but I
won't."
</p>

<p>
Rufus moved a little nearer.  "Jenny,
we've each got a minus sign against
us&mdash;there's no getting over that; but Holy
Moses! you're hung all over so thick with
plus signs that your minus doesn't show up
at all!  Your face, your eyes, your hair, your
voice, your disposition, your spunk, your
common sense&mdash;all plus!  The trouble is
with me.  There would be times when a
girl might blush if she had a one-armed
husband!"
</p>

<p>
"Blush?  If she did she ought to be struck
by lightning!"&mdash;and Jenny's eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
Rufus caught her hands.  "Jenny, Jenny,
be true with me, speak straight out!  Do I
seem a little short of a full man?  How do
you see me in your secret heart?"
</p>

<p>
Jenny rose to her feet under a kind of
spell that made him rise to meet her.  She
leaned against him and said: "I see you
whole, and strong and precious and splendid,
Rufus!"
</p>

<p>
Rufus held her close, drying his secret
tears on her hair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you little brick!" he whispered.
"You darling, winsome little brick!  Would
you mind kissing me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least!" she answered, and was
proceeding to do it with all her heart when
Alfinso entered with a huge armful of
kindling, which he dropped into the woodbox
with such force that the house shook.
</p>

<p>
"Alfinso, you dropped something.  I
heard you distinctly."  Rufus was cool and
collected as he put Jenny back in her chair.
"Now I've some news for you.  Jenny and
I are going to be married on Christmas Eve
and your family is invited.  Will you take
care of the house while I go to Boston and
get all my papers and passports and
identifications and finger-prints and certificates
and army records and honorable discharges
and pedigrees, and draw my back pay&mdash;because
I am a stranger in Riverboro and I
want to get into society.  Why don't you
speak?  Aren't you surprised?"
</p>

<p>
"I would 'a' been," said the boy, '"cept
that Alfonso and the postmistress both said
it would turn out that way; but Mother
stood up for Jenny; she said it wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"That's what all the women will have
said," laughed Rufus.
</p>

<p>
"Well, all the men will say I jumped at
you, so accounts will be square!" and Jenny
smiled triumphantly back at Rufus, all
blushes and confusion, her heart beating
like a wild bird in her breast.  "Go, Rufus,
please," she said in a low tone, "and take
Alfinso.  I want to be alone with myself and
get used to&mdash;happiness."
</p>

<p>
He bent over her and kissed her cheek
while Alfinso went for his muffler and
mittens.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by!  I'll bring back the ring; don't
forget the party.  We won't stint refreshments.
I'll give the twins a dollar to bring
you little trees and evergreens for garlands
and we'll make a brave showing of the house.
Isn't it lucky there'll be a full moon on the
shingles?  No doubt about the minister
now!  He'll have to come in the performance
of his duty.  Oh! my dear, my dear, God is
being very good to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Good to <i>us</i>," whispered Creeping Jenny,
putting her lips softly and shyly against his
sleeve.

<h3>
THE AUTHOR'S READING AT BIXBY CENTRE
</h3>

<p class="quote">
[<i>Those readers who are familiar with "Timothy's
Quest" will remember, perhaps, that Aunt Hitty
Tarbox is a village seamstress and dressmaker who goes
out by the day in Pleasant River and Edgewood, her
specialty being the making-over of boys' clothes.
Perhaps they will recall, too, that she uses her needle,
her scissors, and her tongue with equal rapidity, and
that each one of them is about as sharp as the other,
although she is a member of the Orthodox church in
good and regular standing.  After thirty years' life
in Pleasant River, that quiet village has proved too
small for her genius, and she has removed to the more
thriving town of Bixby Centre, an imaginary place
located anywhere in the State of Maine.  Mrs. Strout,
an old friend from Milliken's Mills, has
come to visit Bixby for a day or two; and it is during
a call upon Aunt Hitty that she gains a general idea
of the Author's Reading which has just occurred.
Imagine Aunt Hitty, then, in a comfortable sewing-chair,
her lapboard on her knee, workbasket within
reach, tongue in excellent running order, and one eye
always on the road which goes past her window&mdash;for
she is one of the few persons who can make over boys'
clothes, conduct a fire of conversation, and miss nothing
that goes on in the outside world, all at once.</i>]
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
MONOLOGUE: Mrs. Silas Tarbox, otherwise
Aunt Hitty, speaking:
</p>

<p>
"Step right in, Mis' Strout.  I should 'a'
come over to see you before this, but I can't
stir from my chair to-day, my foot's so lame.
I'm glad you brought your fancy-work, for
I'm so behindhand with my sewin' I don't
dass to lay down my needle.  We've had the
busiest week of the whole summer, and Si not
bein' through with his hayin' we had to keep
right along with it, entertainment or no
entertainment, so I had work inside as well
as outside the house.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, the Readin' was a great success,
as everything is in Bixby Centre, when
we get round to it; but it made lots o' work,
I can tell you.  It's kind o' queer you don't
have none o' these things over to Milliken's
Mills&mdash;but there! there ain't many small
places that's got the talent we have here to
the Centre, and talent allers attracts talent,
somehow.  Si 'n' I lived for thirty years in
Pleasant River, and we know well enough
what a dull place that was.  They couldn't
even get up a funeral there, without I planned
it and managed it.
</p>

<p>
"No, the entertainment wa'n't for the
church; it was for the benefit of the Winter
Night Reading Club, but, of course, we had
to give it in one of the three meetin'-houses,
for we ain't got any hall.  Oh, yes, I'm a
member of the club, an' I was real pleased
when they asked me to join it, for though I
never was a great hand at readin' to myself
I like to git into a rockin'-chair and hear
other folks read out loud.
</p>

<p>
"Is there enough people in Bixby to fill
three meetings?  Why, no, there ain't; but
nobody expects to see a church filled nowadays.
Money?  Of course there ain't enough
to support three societies, but land! a church
has something else to think about except
being supported, I guess!  For that matter,
there ain't always enough Democrats to
elect a President, but they go right on being
Democrats whether they git anything or
not.  They git the fun o' bein' Democrats,
't any rate, if there's any fun in it, or
Baptists or Universalists, or whatever 'tis!
</p>

<p>
"When we come to decidin' which church
we should have the Readin' in, there was
consid'able talk, and finally we settled it by
writin' to the author and askin' her if she
had any preference, and she wrote back and
said she was a 'piscopalian, and we hadn't
one of them and couldn't get one to oblige
her; and I never had no opinion of 'em
anyhow, for if they was anyways smart they
wouldn't have to have their prayers written
all out for 'em.  I forgot to say that some of
the club wanted a gentleman author.  As
we'd never hed one here before, and might
never hev one again, some of 'em thought
best to have the real article while we was
about it; but the rest of us concluded a lady
author'd come cheaper, and Mis' Stevens
settled it by declarin' that she was goin' to
do the entertainin' and she wouldn't have a
man under foot.  Yes, of course, Mr. Stevens
is alive, but she's got him trained so't he
don't stay in the house much.  They say he
keeps store jest so's he can hev a place to
stop evenin's.
</p>

<p>
"After a good deal o' talk we agreed to
hev the Readin' in the Baptist meetin'-house
to please Mis' Stevens.  She vowed
she wouldn't entertain the author without
we did, and she has the biggest house in the
village and the best spare room, and if she
happens to be in a good temper she takes
three tickets besides, so we always flatter
her up and calm her down all we can when
there's anything going on.  You wa'n't
brought up hereabouts, so you ain't familiar
with the Stover temper; Mis' Stevens was
one of the Stovers of Scarboro', and there
was temper enough in that family, if it was
thinned out, to spread over the whole o'
York County.  Peace was the youngest, and
she lost one likely beau by kickin' the churn
out o' the door jest as he happened to pass
by one morning; then she went away on a
visit to Bangor and married Mr. Stevens.
He's prospered and she's dretful ambitious.
She's bound and determined that Bixby
Centre shall keep right up with Bangor and
Portland.
</p>

<p>
"They've had these Author's Readin's
in the cities lately, and the Winter Night
Club's ben saving up money for one this two
years, and they was determined to do it up
in style, so they wrote to the author they'd
decided on and told her they wa'n't goin'
to spare expense, and she could have five
dollars and railroad fare if she'd come and
read, and she should stop with Mis' Stevens
at the Upper Corner, the one who entertained
Thomas B. Reed when he was here.
She sent word right back that she was
expectin' to be in Portland for a month and
she could just as well come out as not, and
wouldn't trouble us to pay the five dollars.
She said it would be pleasure and profit
enough to meet the committee that had
been correspondin' with her.  I didn't
suspicion that writers was rich enough to refuse
a five-dollar bill, but mebbe she had money
left to her by somebody, and was kind of
independent.
</p>

<p>
"'What air these Author's Readin's,
anyhow?' said Si.  'Can authors read any
better'n other folks?'
</p>

<p>
"'I dunno <i>as</i> they can, an' I dunno <i>but</i>
they can,' says I.  'I suppose we've got to
resk our twenty-five cents an' hear 'em,
before we can say.'
</p>

<p>
"When the author was writin' to the
secretary of the club she put in a newspaper
piece showin' how folks paid a dollar and a
half a ticket to hear her read in Cleveland
and Si said if anybody was willin' to pay that
price to hear an author, and a lady one at
that, read her own writin's it was a case of
fool and his money bein' soon parted.  The
secretary hed to come out real blunt and
plain and say we allers hed got the best in
Bixby Centre for twenty-five cents and we
cal'lated we allers should.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it wa'n't what you would call
'skilled labor,' anyway.  She didn't make
no pretense hardly; she read straight along,
good and clear, but she wa'n't no
elocutionist, and she didn't act out anything a
mite.  In one way she can't hold a candle to
that Miss&mdash;what's that black-haired girl's
name that's cousin to Mis' Tucker of the
Lower Corner?  Well, anyway, she graduated
at a school of oratory, and she's ben here
twice an' recited 'Asleep on the Switch' and
'The Maniac.'  It comes high, for she has to
be drove to and from the deepot, have her
supper and breakfast and a dollar in money;
but you can't have the same old thing all
the year round; folks get tired of it and the
house won't be filled.
</p>

<p>
"Mis' Tucker says her cousin's got real
talent, and I guess she has.  She's got
courage, anyhow, and lungs!  They say she
took a gold medal the time she graduated.
The whole class stood up in a row and
recited 'The Maniac,' and she outscreeched
all the rest without half trying.  Did you
ever hear it, Mis' Strout?  The girl in the
piece is as crazy as a loon, but she don't
know it, and at the end of every verse she
says,'<i>I am not mad!  I am not mad!</i>'  Well,
this reciter&mdash;what <i>is</i> her name now?&mdash;I
know it as well as I do my own!  Her
mother was one o' them hombly Muckfords
that used to live over on the Flag Medder
road.  Well, anyway, the rest o' the class
jest said '<i>I am not mad</i>' in the craziest way
they could; but when it come her turn
they say she put in a screech right in the
middle that you could 'a' heard all over the
county, and the judges fairly leapt right
out o' their seats on the platform.  There
wa'n't no discussion as to who should have
the medal; she earned it and she got it.
She's splendid&mdash;Eldora Duncombe&mdash;that's
her name, and I'm glad I've got it at
last&mdash;but so many of our ladies here sleeps
alone in their houses at nights that they
told Mis' Tucker they couldn't go hear her
cousin any more unless she read quieter
pieces; an' she said if she read quieter pieces
what would be the good of knowin' elocution?
</p>

<p>
"This author wa'n't no elocutionist and
no screecher neither, but she hed a kind of a
takin' way with her after all&mdash;I must say
that; though Si thought her hair was full
red to read in public with.  Did you hear
how handsome the church looked?  If
speakers don't like the pulpit we gen'rally
move it one side and have a marble-top
table with a pitcher of water and a tumbler,
and a boquet of verbenias on it; but there
was a girl from Lowell summer-boardin' at
Mis' Doctor Smith's&mdash;Hazel Perkins her
name is&mdash;an' she'd ben to an Author's
Readin', an' she offered to decorate the
platform jest like a parlor.  It looked
handsome, but land, it was queer!  I never see
such a collection of onnecessary things in my
life.  Si said it looked to him as if the Old
Boy'd ben havin' an auction on it!  And the
trouble that Perkins girl took, borrowin'
from all the neighbors that lived within a
mile o' the meetin'-house!  Why, I declare,
the audience stared so at the decorations
they didn't pay no kind of attention to the
reader.  We ain't got so much furniture
round here that we don't know the looks of
our neighbors' things pretty well, and
everybody was cranin' and gapin' and studyin'
to see who'd ben asked to lend and who
hadn't.  Si told Miss Perkins if she'd 'a'
put on a bed and a cook-stove the author
could 'a' kep' house on the platform and
ben real comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"There was Mis' Trowbridge's banquet
lamp that her children got for a prize, sellin'
Magic Soap (and there ain't much magic in
it, I can tell you that, unless you mix
consid'able elbow grease with it!); I thought it
was real good in the Trowbridge children to
lend that lamp, for it's the only namable
stick o' furniture they've got in the room
they call their parlor, and they set great
store by it.  They'd never lighted it up
'cause they couldn't afford karosene, but
anyway Mis' Trowbridge never read a book
in her life, I guess, and Dan Trowbridge goes
to bed at sundown; Salomy Trowbridge&mdash;she's
the fourteen-year-old girl&mdash;never
took her eyes off the lamp the whole evening,
and once when it kind o' flared up, and
she thought it was goin' to scorch the pink
shade, she went right up on the platform
and turned it down so't the author couldn't
hardly see to read.  Almiry Berry's reflecting
lamp was on the stage, too, and hanging
from it was an ear o' corn gilded, with a
thermometer let in where some o' the
kernels was took out&mdash;it looked real kind o'
cute!  Widow Buzzell's wicker chair and
walnut table set in the centre, and if she hadn't
bronzed up the chair with Diamond Paint
so't nobody recognized it!  Diadema Bascom's
foreroom rug was on the floor, and my
Batterbug lace tidies on the pulpit chairs.
My lunge stood in the back with an
African over it, and a couple of sofy-pillows
stood up on end.  What the Perkins girl
wanted it there for beats me, for no author
that I ever see would lay down while she
was readin', and after it's over she'd be glad
to go home and go to bed, I should think.  I
didn't like it a mite that Miss Perkins put
the African over it, for we'd just had it new
covered with emmanuel cloth and it looked
real handsome and shiny; Si's awful fond of
lungeing, and I thought I'd buy something
this time he <i>couldn't</i> lunge out!  Well, if you
have a decoratin' committee I s'pose you've
got to give 'em their heads and let 'em
decorate; so I didn't say nothin' to Miss
Perkins.
</p>

<p>
"On the piano was my marble statue of
Abraham Lincoln, and Mis' Emerson's pair
of tall vases that Huldy Packard sent her
from Indiana.  Miss Perkins had filled 'em
full of goldenrod, but when Judge Thomson
come and seen 'em standin' on his wife's new
upright pianer he said he couldn't have that
nohow; so when the audience was seatin',
and before the Readin' began, Miss Perkins
had to empty the water out o' the vases
and stick peacock feathers in 'em; and then
when the author come her cousin was with
her, and she didn't like the peacock feathers
'cause they was unlucky; so poor Miss
Perkins hove 'em out the winder and set the
vases on the pianer upside down.  They're
awful hombly, anyway, and they look 'bout
as well empty as full, an' standin' 'em
bottomside up don't hurt the pattern any.
</p>

<p>
"The Perkins girl went out on the church
steps and cried, she was so hoppin' mad,
and when I slipped out o' the back pew to
see if I could borry a piece of ice to put in
the author's pitcher I see Freedom Cobb,
that's home from Dartmouth College, tryin'
to comfort her.  She don't know that he
courts Mis' Doctor Smith's boarders right
along summer after summer.  Mis' Smith
couldn't hold 'em, her meat's so tough, if
Freedom didn't kind o' keep 'em contented
courtin' of 'em!  I was sorry for her; but
there, it wouldn't 'a' done to spill water down
into the Thomsons' new pianer the way we
done into the one we hired from Edgecombe
Falls.  Mis' Thomson only let us have hern
on condition that we wouldn't ask Clarence
Cummins to play on it.  He's had lessons for
three years, and then, anyway, he's
naturally strong in his fingers and powerful
muscled all over.  You'd certainly think he
wouldn't leave a key on the instrument
when he gits warmed up.  He's a great
favorite with the deef, and we've got a lot
o' deef folks at Bixby Centre.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear anything said about the
minister's introduction?  That's kind o'
queer; the Congregationalists was real proud
of his remarks.  Of course there's most
every sect represented in the Winter Night
Club, and then there's some of the members
that wouldn't know a sect if they seen one
in the middle o' the road, though they do
call this a Christian country.  We said if the
entertainment was held in the Baptist church
our minister had ought to make the opening
remarks.  We've got a real smart man in
Mr. Hobson; some think he's too old, but
there! we was about wore out with young
students during them four years when we
didn't have no settled pastor.  Si says to
me: 'I declare I'm tired o' settin' in meetin'
Sunday after Sunday and hearin' the law
laid down to me by them half-fledged boys.
Let's have a minister that's feathered out,'
said he, 'even if we hev to pay a little more!'
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Hobson's makin' the
introduction didn't leave anything for the
Methodist minister to do, and his wife was
as mad as hops, but we pacified her by askin'
him to give the author a vote of thanks
after the Readin', and by puttin' her on the
reception committee that met the author at
the deepot.  The Perkins girl wanted the
deepot decorated with goldenrod, but the
president of the club said we'd got to leave
something to do in case the folks that wrote
'Paradise Lost' or 'Pilgrim's Progress'
should come to Bixby to read.  So we had
the winders washed and the stove blacked,
put a new chimbly on the lamp and carried
the fly-paper into the telegraph office, and
Si said the deepot looked as if 'twas goin'
to be married; but the author swished right
through it and never looked at the stove
nor the winders, so we had our labor for our
pains.
</p>

<p>
"The weather looked a little mite lowery
at noon, and Mis' Stevens was afraid she'd
have to git out her covered carry-all to go
for the author, but the sun came out and it
breezed up real nice just after three o'clock.
I don't think Mis' Stevens was ever uglier
or contrarier in her life than she was that
afternoon, but we excused her, for she was
most tired to death.  Her hired girl is sick,
and she'd ben helpin' her cook up flour-food
for the author, sellin' tickets over to the
Centre, and finishin' a worsted-work 'God
Bless Our Home' to hang over the
spare-room bed.  Si said he guessed the comp'ny
would find out before she left that house
that God done the only blessin' it was likely
to git, and he was about right.  She didn't
like it a mite because Mis' Doctor Smith
shook hands with the author first, and it was
kind o' forth-puttin'.  Mis' Stevens is the
president of the Baptist and Mis' Doctor
Smith of the Congregational Ladies' Aid,
and most of the quarrelin' and pull-haulin'
in the churches is between them two
societies.  They aid the church consid'able,
I s'pose, but they do hender each other
awf'ly; I'll say that for 'em!
</p>

<p>
"Well, it turned out a beautiful night,
and the meetin'-house was packed to the
doors.  Everything went off as neat as a pin
when we once got the Readin' goin', but the
committee had consid'able trouble at the
start.  First there was the fuss I told you
'bout Mis' Thomson's pianer, and Hazel
Perkins hed to hev her cry out on Freedom
Cobb's shoulder, and then it turned out
there wa'n't no ice for the water-pitcher;
and those that hed reserved seats in the
choir was in trouble.  You see Miss Perkins
hed put appleboughs along the front o'
the singin'-seats and on top o' the organ.
There must 'a' ben caterpillars' nests in 'em,
and I s'pose the Decorating Committee hed
et their lunch up there and dropped crumbs,
but 't any rate the folks was kep' busy
killin' ants an' caterpillars.  One woman
that was a stranger to me said she didn't
cal'late to pay extry for a seat an' then be et
up in it.
</p>

<p>
"The next thing was that Doctor Woodside
couldn't be found to take the author up
the broad aisle on his arm and hand her over
to the minister.  I was 'bout sick o' trottin',
but I went out again and found him settin'
in the graveyard as comf'table as could be,
smokin' there on a tombstone, with the full
moon shinin' on his white hair.  He's one o'
the smartest men in town, but some folks
call him kind o' queer in the head.  He does
spend a good deal of his time in the graveyard,
but Si says it's only natural because
most of his patients is there!  Then, as if that
wa'n't enough, Vilruvias Bennett, that was
sellin' tickets at the door, was called home,
and they wanted Si to take his place, an'
Si was huntin' after Almiry Berry's horse
that had broke away an' carried part o' the
meetin'-house fence.
</p>

<p>
"You'd heard Vilruvias's brother, Abel
Bennett, died that night, didn't you?  Well,
did you know how suddent it was?  He'd
never hed a sick day in his life, so we hed no
hopes of ever gettin' red of him; though
there wa'n't a worse husband nor father
nor neighbor in Bixby.  His mother hed
consid'able better 'a' named him Cain than
Abel, but you can't never tell by lookin'
at little mites o' bald-headed, red-faced
things in cradles whether they're going to
turn out Abels or Cains.  Well, he'd refused
to buy a ticket to the Readin', and he never
would let his wife join the club; but about
half-past six o'clock the very night o' the
entertainment he eat a hearty supper of
brown bread and pork and beans, got up
and took his hat, kicked the dog and the cat
and cuffed the children, which he'd done
every night and mornin' faithful for twelve
years, went out the side door and expired
right there on the rubber door-mat where
Mis' Bennett would have to step on him to
get out; and it'll be easier for a camel to get
through the needle's eye than for him to git
int' the Kingdom, that's all I've got to say,
and I'm a woman o' few words!
</p>

<p>
"Nobody knew what Vilruvias was called
away for till after the Readin', so there
wa'n't no excitement at the entertainment.
The author said afterwards when the
committee was givin' her a colation (it was an
elegant one, too&mdash;lemon pie and jelly cake
and marble cake and caraway cookies, and
root beer and lemonade) that if she had
known it she should 'a' ben afraid it was a
bad sign.'
</p>

<p>
"'Not if you'd ever hed Abel Bennett for
a neighbor,' said Si; and he was about right,
though it sounds hard to say it, and he didn't
but jest a few times!
</p>

<p>
"No, I ain't said much about the Readin'
itself, for ef you're on a committee you're
too busy to listen to anything that goes on.
The author looked pretty and appeared
pretty; she got on first-rate with Mis'
Stevens, and gave her a book, with writin'
in the front of it, that Mis' Stevens keeps
on her marble-top table in the parlor.  Si
says ef Mis' Stevens ever wants to dispose
of it the writin' will spoil the trade, but I
tell him the author meant all right, and Mis'
Stevens is too well off to sell a present that
was give to her, anyway.  The audience was
real pleased with the author, and she said
they was awful easy to read to, and awful
quick at takin' a joke; but I told her it wa'n't
no ordinary State o' Maine audience she hed
in Bixby: a place that has its three churches
and two settled ministers and four college
graduates, an' a Readin' Club an' a High
School and a drinkin' fountain!  She said no,
she couldn't expect to meet with such folks
everywhere, but the remembrance of hevin'
once enjoyed sech advantages would keep
her up when she was hevin' hard times in
other places.  I thought that was real modest
and pretty of her.
</p>

<p>
"She wa'n't no great reader, as I say, and
she wa'n't no great writer for that matter,
and I can't hardly see why they should
make a fuss over her in the cities.  Her
stories might 'a' happened anywhere, most;
they never did happen, I s'pose, but they
sounded so natural and likely that it couldn't
'a' ben much work to write 'em down.  I
declare if she'd 'a' ben here this afternoon and
took down what we've said, 'twould 'a' ben
'bout as good as what she read that night.
I wouldn't wonder if I could write a couple
of books a year jest like hers, but I don't
s'pose it pays so well as goin' out by the day
sewin', an', as Si says, we're in this world for
a livin', not for notoriety.
</p>

<p>
"The next mornin' the committee went
to the deepot to see the author off, and the
four young men ushers was there, too, with
the biggest and about the hombliest boquet
I ever set eyes on!  I don't hardly know how
she could 'a' took it in her hand without
changin' color.  I got there first, and I was
glad I did, for the deepot master hed forgot
and laid out that old fly-paper all over the
benches in the waitin'-room, and I hed a
chance to yank it out o' sight and dust
down the stove-pipe before she come in.
Mis' Stevens looked real smilin' for once,
and asked her to come back and make her
a visit when it was cooler weather and her
hired girl was over the whoopin'-cough.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hobson was there, and he handed
her an envelope with two railroad tickets to
Portland inside of it.  It was just like him to
buy the tickets and put 'em in an envelope;
the other minister would 'a' counted the
dollar and seventeen cents into her hand&mdash;and
just as she was gettin' on the train the
president of the Readin' Club stepped up
and presented her with an album that hed
the photographs of all the members pasted
in it.
</p>

<p>
"Si says it ain't the handsomest club in
the United States, even when it gets its
best clothes on; but that's nothin' but a
man's way of runnin' down women's clubs.
We ain't all good lookin', to be sure, and
most of the pictures was taken in country
daguerreon saloons, where they don't flatter
folks up much.  I did kind o' wish Lowisy
Burrage hed hed her new glasses and Aurelia
Hanson her waved front piece before they
was taken, but the author was too tickled
for anything to git such a handsome present,
and she said so; and says the president of
the club to her, 'You ain't a mite tickleder'n
we be to give it to you!'  Then the train went
off, the author lookin' back from the
platform, the committee wavin' their
handkerchiefs, and Mr. Hobson 'n' the four ushers
swingin' their hats at her.
</p>

<p>
"All in all it was 'bout the most successful
entertainment we ever bed here to Bixby,
and we made forty dollars clear, though the
land knows we put work enough into it to
make seventy-five!  There's one thing
certain, wherever that author goes readin' she
won't find any place that'll do the thing up
in the same style as the Winter Night Club
did when it entertained her at Bixby!
</p>

<p>
"Must you go so soon, Mis' Strout?
Well, it's ben real nice to see you and hear
all the news from Milliken's Mills."

<h3>
THE QUILT OF HAPPINESS
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Riverboro, that generally assumed an
indifferent and semi-recumbent attitude when
it observed strangers, sat up and took notice
the moment that Rebecca Rowena Randall
arrived on the noon stage from up-country
and alighted at the brick house on the main
street of the village.  Mrs. Perkins, the
nearest neighbor, with her only daughter,
Emma Jane, palpitating with interest beside
her, watched the cautious descent of the
little passenger from the stage and the
particularly tempestuous tweak she gave
her headgear as her feet touched the earth.
Then they watched with equal interest the
lifting of her hair trunk from the back of the
stage by Jerry Cobb; the appearance of Miss
Jane on the stone steps; and well at the rear,
the tall, grim figure of Miranda Sawyer.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Perkins could see Miranda's greeting
in the shape of a bony finger directing
the child to wipe her dusty feet on the mat;
then the screen door of the brick house
slammed behind her, and Rebecca was a
member of the brick-house family and a
citizen of Riverboro.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little mite!" sighed Mrs. Perkins.
</p>

<p>
"Can I go over and see her now?" asked
Emma Jane, already cherishing hopes of
intimacy.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you can't!" responded her
mother briskly.  "Do you s'pose Mirandy
wants the house full o' comp'ny the minute
Rebecca gits there?"
</p>

<p>
"Just me wouldn't make it full," objected
Emma Jane.
</p>

<p>
"It takes precious few to make a house
too full to please Mirandy Sawyer!" and
Mrs. Perkins resumed her seat at the window
overlooking the river.  "You can keep an
eye on the gate, an' if they let her ou'doors
again to-night you can run over and scrape
acquaintance, if you want to."
</p>

<p>
Now Rebecca's vivid little personality
had been somewhat obscured in the big
family of children at Sunnybrook Farm, but
in Riverboro it had the effect of a Roman
candle suddenly bursting among the lesser
fireworks on a Fourth-of-July evening.
She was extraordinarily gregarious and
within a year knew everybody on both sides
of the river.  "Anybody'll do for Rebecca
so long's it's folks!" grumbled her Aunt
Miranda.  "This street is gen'ally chock-full
o' young ones nowadays, and Rebecca's
always eggin' 'em on to somethin' new.
When she asks me if she can borrer the silver
call bell an' I see her makin' off with a lead
pencil an' paper, I always suspicion she's
organizin' somethin'."
</p>

<p>
Miranda was right.  There had been a
positive epidemic of organizations in Riverboro's
"younger set" in the last few months.
Most of them had died an early, though
natural, death, while others had been put
out of existence by unfeeling parents and
guardians.  Miss Dearborn, the village
teacher, was really the inspiring force
behind the first one.  Feeling a lack of com-
mon purpose in the district school, she had
proposed a club for general improvement
and public service of some sort.  In order to
develop initiative and executive ability, she
asked the older girls and boys to meet alone
to draft a constitution and choose a name.
She was somewhat confused when they
issued from their executive session quickly
and firmly entitled The Jolly Jumpers, and
learned that the officers were to be selected,
not for intellectual or moral superiority,
but according to the height that they were
able to jump over a broomstick.  This
unintentionally athletic society still had its
healthful and noisy meetings now and again,
although it never fulfilled Miss Dearborn's
ambitions.
</p>

<p>
The Guild of Ministering Sisters could
not find anybody who desired its ministrations,
but one or two secret societies were in
a flourishing condition, notably The Bouncers.
Mr. Perkins, the local blacksmith, had
a way of saying to the young people, when
they had interrupted his horse-shoeing long
enough: "Now clear out, young ones, or I'll
bounce ye!" The idea of this picturesquely
named society was that, if any member
should be caught cheating in games or
lessons, fibbing or tale-bearing, or in other
misdemeanors of equal magnitude, he&mdash;or
she&mdash;would find a card on desk, or in hat,
with this neatly printed phrase on it:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  YOU ARE HEREBY BOUNCED<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The shame and terror of this card oppressed
the most callous boy, and, his mind
reverting to the last sin that he had
committed and wondering how it could have been
found out, he promptly turned over a new
leaf in order to be reinstated in good society.
</p>

<p>
The success of the month of June had
been a club called The Pantry Rioters.
Romeo Smith, a dimpled, wide-mouthed,
freckle-faced boy was the founder, and the
first members were all of the (then) superior
sex.  The girls, however, discovered the
general intentions of the club, and Rebecca
drafted such an engaging constitution and
by-laws that the boys chivalrously widened
the gates of membership.  Rebecca, whose
eligibility as an active member did not
admit a shadow of doubt, was constrained
to decline all but honorary connection with
The Pantry Rioters; and those who knew
the discipline of the brick house admitted
the wisdom of her decision.  "But oh, how I
could riot if only I wasn't being fed and
clothed and slept and schooled by Aunt
Miranda!" thought Rebecca passionately,
as she carefully copied the by-laws of The
Pantry Rioters:
</p>

<p>
"1. No member shall riot in anybody's
else pantry but his own.
</p>

<p>
"2. No member shall attack the swing-shelf
or wire netting box in the cellar as being
too easy and not risky enough, and not a
pantry anyway.
</p>

<p>
"3. No member shall be greedy or really
thievish, nor shall he nibble or take away
anything that is needed for the next meal,
if he knows it; this being not nice, besides
making trouble all round.
</p>

<p>
"4. Any member who does a rioting act
of great daring right under the eye of the
enemy shall be allowed to wear a red button
to school.
</p>

<p>
"5. Any member who is caught in the
act of rioting and reprimanded, and so forth,
shall wear a blue button to school and
describe all the circumstances, however
painful, at a meeting of the club, where he will
receive comfort and sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"6. Any little titbit subtracted from the
pantry may be shared with another member,
thus removing any suspicion of evil from
rioting; the idea being to show that a person
could take a tart, doughnut, frosted cake, or
spoonful of preserves at any time if only he
was not so good and honest."

<p>
Oh, how delicious were the last school
days of the June term when The Pantry
Rioters first came into being!  Who could
forget the morning when Romeo Smith
arrived at school flushed and panting and
took his place in the line within one minute
of being tardy?  And there, in the button-hole
of his coat lapel, gleamed the red badge
of courage, the button covered by the girls
with scarlet ribbon, but never worn before!
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock Miss Dearborn remarked:
"Romeo Smith is well prepared with his
lessons and is behaving himself with perfect
propriety, except for a perpetual grin, for
which I can see no reason.  However, as
many of the scholars cannot help staring at
him, I would ask him please to remove the
red button he is wearing and place it in his
vest pocket."
</p>

<p>
In the reading lesson when Sam Simpson
came to the phrase, "The spy gave a paltry
excuse," he read it, "pantry excuse," and
there was such a flood of laughter let loose
in the schoolroom that Miss Dearborn was
obliged to say: "Did no one ever mistake
a word before?  It is not polite to make fun
of another scholar.  You may be the next
one yourself."
</p>

<p>
And then, after school, to hear from
Romeo's lips that his mother, in passing out
of the pantry with a colander full of fresh
doughnuts under her left arm, had paused
to lean from the window and speak to her
husband; whereupon Romeo, with magnificent
audacity&mdash;grandmother in adjacent
kitchen, mother holding pan, and father
outside window&mdash;had seized a hot doughnut
and, mindful of the red button, had further
tempted fate by taking the knife from the
cheese plate and carving off a piece two
inches wide!  With this rich booty, avoiding
the safe side door, he went through the
living-room, passing a visiting aunt and two
younger brothers of highly suspicious
disposition, and sped to school in time to avoid
the tardy mark.
</p>

<p>
"How perfectly elegant!" ejaculated
Emma Jane Perkins.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the doughnut?" asked
Rebecca, mindful of the sixth by-law.
</p>

<p>
"I had nowheres to keep it but under my
hat, so I et it up; but you can see the place
where it was."  And Romeo exhibited the
shiny circular spot on the top of his head
where the hot doughnut had lain.

</p>

<p>
School had been closed for two weeks
now, and one afternoon Rebecca leaned
over her gate and surveyed the landscape.
Emma Jane Perkins was watching from her
doorway, and Alice Robinson from hers,
while several other girls were concealed
behind board-piles or clumps of trees, waiting
for the hour of play to arrive.  Suddenly all
hearts leaped with gladness, for Rebecca
was seen to remove the brown ribbon from
one of her braids and put it in her apron
pocket, and to substitute a piece of bright
pink, legal tape.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing to your hair,
Rebecca?" asked Aunt Jane, coming to the
door unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Changing one of my ribbons, Aunt Jane."
</p>

<p>
"What for, child?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a secret, Aunt Jane, but I
don't mind telling you a little bit: it's a
signal.  I can't fire a cannon or build a
bonfire on the heights, so this is just a way of
telling the girls I've got an idea."
</p>

<p>
"I should think they might guess that,
any time, without your decking yourself
out like a horse at a cattle fair," smiled
Aunt Jane.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca laughed and shook her long
braids.  "But it's such a nice, ladylike,
romantic way of signaling, Aunt Jane!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe it is; but take it off before
you come in the house, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"As if I wouldn't, Aunt Jane?  And, anyway,
my idea is new, but it joins on to
something you and Aunt Miranda know about
already&mdash;Miss Roxy's quilt."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" sighed Miss Jane comfortably.
"If it's nothing worse than that I won't
worry."
</p>

<p>
"It's a beautiful idea!" and Rebecca
glowed.  "The girls will love it, and Miss
Dearborn, and the minister's wife; and you
would, too, but I mustn't show partiality
between you and Aunt Miranda.  The
mothers will think it's silly, so it's got to be
kept secret."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  They all approved of
your making extra patchwork, and if you're
any happier to put your work together so
that it will amount to something, and if you
want to give it away, why, it's all to your
credit, and it doesn't cost any one family
much.  You'd better give up the notion of
quilting it, Rebecca."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why, Aunt Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you five girls could never finish
it by cold weather.  I'll put it in the frame
for you and teach you how to 'tack' it."
</p>

<p>
"We all know how to quilt," objected Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you don't know what it is to
take those thousands of little stitches all in
even rows.  You can't break your thread, or
make knots, or pucker the quilt; and the
part near the edges of the frame is very
hard to do neatly.  Have you chosen your
pattern?"
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll choose the pattern this
afternoon.  We've looked at all the spare
bedroom quilts there are in Riverboro.  There's
Mrs. Perkins's 'Goose Chase,' and
Mrs. Robinson's 'Church Steps,' Mrs. Milliken's
'Rising Sun,' Mrs. Watson's 'Job's Troubles,'
Mrs. Meserve's 'Duck's Foot in the
Mud,' and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miss Jane put her fingers in her ears.
"Goodness gracious, Rebecca, how you do
run on!  I hope you don't forget your Aunt
Miranda's 'Johnny Round the Corner';
but don't you girls fly too high or you'll
come down heavy.  You can get gay, pretty
pieces and put four in a square and then join
your squares corner to corner with plain
ones in between.  Perhaps Mrs. Perkins will
have some new goods to help you out, and
that'll set off the patchwork.  Now, it's four
o'clock and you can go and play, Rebecca."
</p>

<p>
Rebecca sped like an arrow shot from a
bow, Emma Jane sped contemporaneously;
Alice Robinson, Candace Milliken, and
Persis Watson appeared as suddenly as if
they had been concealed in woodchuck holes.
</p>

<p>
Miss Jane looked wistfully after the five
slim little figures disappearing with arms
about one another's waists and heads close
together.  "A child makes a wonderful
difference," she thought.  "I don't know what
Aurelia's other children are like, but I can't
think how she could part with Rebecca,
even to get her educated!  Anyhow it's put
the sun back into the sky for me!"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Old Miss Roxanna Lyman lived half a
mile up the river road and an eighth of a
mile up a lane that led from it and stopped
at her dooryard.  Why the house was ever
built there was a mystery.  If you were a
stranger in Riverboro and were walking
up to play with the Simpson children and
found everybody away from home, and had
spied high-bush blueberries a little farther
on, and chokecherry trees in full bearing
in a green lane, that you had never noticed
before, and had strayed along the grass-grown
road that had known hardly a wagon
wheel for years, you would finally have
passed an obscuring clump of trees and
come suddenly upon Miss Roxy's little
black house.
</p>

<p>
At least that was what Rebecca did.  The
door was open, andsitting in a rocking-chair
in the tiny entry was, as Rebecca reported
to Miss Jane later, "the very most
sorrowfullest old lady any one had ever seen."  No
one could have told her age.  She was slight
and spare; she was huddled in a gray shawl;
the wrinkles in her face&mdash;wrinkles of pain,
anxiety, grief, poverty, and foreboding&mdash;fairly
made a lattice-work on the skin.  You
knew by looking at her that no one had
gone out from the black house in the
morning and no one was coming back to it at
night.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca had heard of her and instantly
asked: "Are you Miss Roxy Lyman?
Please excuse me for stumbling right into
your dooryard.  I didn't see there was one
till I was in it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'm Roxy Lyman," said the old
lady in a voice that trembled with surprise
and suggested the rarity of callers.  "Won't
you set down a spell?"
</p>

<p>
Rebecca needed no second invitation to
embark on a new experience.  She sank
down on the step, flung her hat on the grass
and pushed the hair back from her warm
forehead.  "I'm Rebecca Rowena Randall,"
she explained fluently.  "My home is at
Sunnybrook Farm, up Temperance way,
but I'm living with my two Aunt Sawyers
at the brick house so's to get educated.
There's no education in Temperance, just
plain teaching, and only a few months a
year.  Sometimes we didn't have any lessons
at all, because when there were big boys
it took all teacher's time to make them
behave.  Down here Miss Dearborn can
manage a big boy as easy as anything, so
of course we have nothing to do but learn."
</p>

<p>
This was only the natural beginning of a
cataract of conversation, and the acquaintance
between Rebecca and Miss Roxy Lyman
was now well started.  Rebecca proceeded
to open her mind on a dozen subjects
of passionate interest to herself.  Clasping
her knees with her hands, she rippled on in
a way never permitted at the brick house.
</p>

<p>
"I like the way your house is set," she
said; "side end to the road, looking down
over the fields and seeing the river
flowing-ways.  I think a black house with vines
growing over it is nice too; a white one
is always so stare-y.  The river's splendid
company, don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"It's all I have," was the reply.  "I don't
look at it much nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"I get tired of looking at the same old hat,
but I never get used to the old river somehow;
but perhaps it isn't quite enough company
all by itself.  Of course there's the trees."
</p>

<p>
"They ain't leaved out the year round,"
said Miss Roxy.
</p>

<p>
"No-o-o.  But you're sure they <i>will</i> 'leave
out.'"  All this time Rebecca had stolen
little side glances at Miss Roxy.  "I suppose
you read when you're not doing house-work?"
she ventured.
</p>

<p>
"I've read all my books over and over
so I just set an' think!"  And Miss Roxy's
eyes wandered from Rebecca, as if she had
already outlived the experience of meeting
a new face and hearing a new voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, all I was going to say is," said
Rebecca, rising to her feet at this warning
signal, "that there was a very sick lady,
sick and lame and old, that lived half a mile
from our farm, and mother always had me
go over and tell her the news once or twice
a week.  Mother says everybody ought to
know what's going on, or they get lonesome.
I've come away from that lady so I think
I'd better take you in her place if you'd like
to have me.  There's such a lot happens
down our way&mdash;awfully interesting things,
too&mdash;that I could reel it off by the yard
this minute, only you seem tired.  And I've
got two books of my own to lend you, so
I'll come soon again if Aunt Miranda'll let
me.  Shall I?"
</p>

<p>
Rebecca's demeanor and tone were modest
and innocent, but Miss Roxy felt herself in
the grip of a master hand and feebly
assented.  "I don't mind if you do," she said,
making an effort, and bringing her eyes
back to the quaint, vivid little creature
standing in front of her on the greensward.
"Mebbe you'd liven me up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I would!" And Rebecca's tone was
full of confidence.  "Aunt Miranda says I'd
stir up a cemetery; but that isn't a compliment.
She doesn't like being stirred up; but
I'd be real careful with you, being a stranger
and not very well!  Good-bye!"  And
Rebecca flew down the lane, her long, dark
braids flying out behind her; while Miss
Roxy, in spite of herself, rose to her feet by
the rocking-chair and watched the child out
of sight.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
There were many meetings after that.
Sometimes Rebecca took one of the other
girls and they carried a bouquet of wild
flowers to put in a tumbler on the kitchen
table, or some apples or berries or nuts that
they had picked on the road; but it was easy
to see that one caller at a time was all that
Miss Roxy fancied.  She had very little to
eat and very little fuel, though she was
known to receive ten dollars a month from
a nephew in Salem, so that Riverboro was
comfortably sure that she could not starve;
and as for firewood, the same nephew had a
load, all sawed and split, deposited in her
shed twice a year.  These mercies gave
assurance of existence if not of luxury; and,
anyway, Riverboro could not waste its
time over an incurably sad, cold, strange,
silent woman like Roxanna Lyman, even if
her family had been one of the best in former
years.
</p>

<p>
Once Rebecca had knocked at Miss
Roxy's door without receiving any answer
and, peeping into the window of the
downstairs chamber where she slept, had seen
her lying on her bed with the gray shawl
round her shoulders and a man's military
coat over her feet.  Like lightning the
thought flashed through the child's mind:
"Why not make a quilt for Miss Roxy?"
</p>

<p>
Patchwork had to be sewed, day in and
day out, as was the custom.  There were
never enough sheets to oversew, and
needlework was a Christian duty; therefore,
patchwork&mdash;in and out of season.  It was
cheap, too.  Nobody would mind if she and
the other girls did extra work, begged their
own pieces, and gave away the result for a
Thanksgiving or Christmas present.  The
matter had been put before mothers and
aunts, accepted, and scraps already
collected.  It only remained to choose the
design.
</p>

<p>
So far so good; but that was not why
Rebecca had tied pink tape on one of her
pigtails&mdash;not at all!  The mere notion of
the quilt, a secret from all the village save
the families involved&mdash;this had enchanted
the five girls from the beginning; but
something else was unfolded in the pine-grove
meeting.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Rebecca, "I was up to
Miss Roxy's last night and she'd been
crying.  She cries 'most every day."
</p>

<p>
"What for, I wonder?  She lives alone, so
there's nobody to be cross to her," said
Alice Robinson, who had troubles of her own.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it's the things that have happened
in bygone days."  (Rebecca had an incurably
literary style in conducting meetings, and
indulged unconsciously in nights of sentiment
and rhetoric.)  "Her mother and father died
and her brother embezzled and Aunt Jane
thinks that a gentleman played with her
feelings and she's never been the same
since."
</p>

<p>
"'Played with her feelings!'  What's
that?" inquired the unsentimental Emma
Jane Perkins.
</p>

<p>
"Gave her hopes and then married
another without saying so much as 'Boo,'"
explained Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
"And there was a sister that did something
dreadful, I don't exactly know what,"
hinted Candace darkly; "but she lives out
West and Miss Roxy writes and writes to
her, but she never answers."
</p>

<p>
"And she was the one Miss Rosy loved
best of all," added Rebecca with a tear in
her voice.  "I asked her yesterday why she
didn't sit in the kitchen with a window open
and not in the little front entry that'll
hardly hold her rocking-chair.  She said if
anybody should come any time suddenly
she could get down the steps quicker to
meet them.  She never comes down to any
of us, and I know it's the sister she means.
Oh, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Mother's awful sorry for her," was
Persis's comment.  "But everybody's kind
of lost sympathy for her because she lives
so out of creation, and it's so much work to
get there."
</p>

<p>
"Well"&mdash;and Rebecca leaned toward
the group confidentially&mdash;"I was thinking
about it night before last as I was leaning
over the gate.  Now look the other way,
girls, and don't laugh while I explain.  All
of a sudden I thought the pieces of our quilt
will be scraps of dresses; why not take those
that we, and all the other people, have had
the loveliest times in?  We could put them
everywhere but round the edges,
everywhere they'd touch Miss Roxy, I
mean&mdash;on her neck and shoulders and arms and
waist and knees.  It'd be a quilt of happiness
then; that's my idea!" And Rebecca waited
with flushing cheeks and downcast eyes for
the verdict.
</p>

<p>
There was a breathless pause of half a
minute.  Emma Jane seldom moved her
mind in the presence of Rebecca, feeling that
competition was impossible; still she was the
first to break the silence with her customary
ejaculation: "I think it would be perfectly
elegant!"
</p>

<p>
Alice Robinson nodded her curly head
responsively and said: '"Quilt of Happiness!'  It
sounds lovely, if we don't have to
tell anybody grown up who would say it's
silly."
</p>

<p>
"But can happiness strike <i>into</i> anybody?"
inquired Candace, who, as the daughter of
an Orthodox deacon, went to the foundation
of things.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was inclined to evade the direct
question, inasmuch as her cherished idea
had no real basis save one of pure sentiment.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help feeling that if we just collect
scraps of happiness," she said shyly, "and
cut and stitch and tack happiness into the
quilt, all in secret, that Miss Roxy'd feel
warmer in it, though, of course, she'd never
guess why."
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered Candace, a little
unconvinced but generously approving, "I
think it couldn't do any harm to try."
</p>

<p>
"And there's just one person we might
tell, for she'd understand and help us get
the right pieces without telling our secret,
and that's teacher."  This suggestion from
Persis Watson.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca clapped her hands delightedly.
</p>

<p>
"Now here comes the greatest piece of
news, and I've been saving it up till the
end!  I did tell Miss Dearborn, last evening.
I couldn't help it, because I couldn't be
sure my idea wasn't foolish till one other
person had heard it&mdash;and what do you
think she told me?  She's engaged to be
married!  Miss Dearborn's engaged to be
married!"
</p>

<p>
This was chanted joyously while Rebecca
skipped over the pine-needle carpet in circles
and waved her arms triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
A chorus of "Oh!" and "Ah!" and
"Who to?" woke the echoes.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca sat down again cross-legged and
proceeded to the telling of a tale which from
the beginning of the world has evoked the
keenest joy in the narrator and the most
rapt attention from the audience.
</p>

<p>
"How did she happen to tell you first?"
asked Persis with a spice of envy in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Just because I was there almost at the
very identical minute when He went away."
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Her beau?" inquired Alice,
blushing to the roots of her hair.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and she'd never tell Mrs. Bangs a
thing like <i>that</i>!"  (Mrs. Bangs was a lady of
difficult temper with whom Miss Dearborn
boarded as painlessly as possible.)  "Don't
you know how you feel when you're full to
bursting with splendid news?  That's how
Miss Dearborn was.  Do you remember the
tall gentleman that came from Hartford
two Saturday nights and went to meeting
with her next day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" in chorus.  "Was that him?"  (Miss
Dearborn spoke and taught good
English; but there are some things that
human beings are powerless to teach&mdash;or
learn!)
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  His name is Robert Hunt, and
teacher says he's an ab-so-lute-ly glorious
man!"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know there was any glorious
men," said Persis.  "I wisht I'd looked at
him harder in meetin'.  When they goin' to
be married?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till next summer, though he's
pleaded for an early date.  (That's what
she said.)  She wants to teach here till the
spring term's over so's to buy her wedding
clothes, and aren't you glad we'll have her
one more winter?  Now, why doesn't
somebody ask me what my news is?"
</p>

<p>
"Gracious!  Is there any more?" they cried.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  Or what has all this to do
with our quilt?  Miss Dearborn just loved
the idea of its being a quilt of happiness.
She kissed me lots of times, and then she got
up and looked in the glass and twirled herself
round and held up her skirt and danced,
and she had on the dress we like best&mdash;the
pink delaine with the moss rosebuds on it&mdash;and
she said, thinking it out as she went
along: 'Rebecca, I've had so much happiness
to-day I must give part of it away!
When Mr. Hunt asked me to marry him
this afternoon, I had on this dress.  The
waist is nearly worn out, but the skirt is as
good as new.  It's got six breadths in it, and
it'll make a beautiful lining for Miss Roxy's
quilt!'  Then I said: 'Oh, that'll be lovely
if you can spare it; but, darling Miss
Dearborn&mdash;excuse me for speaking of it&mdash;they
say that long ago a gentleman from Boston
played with Miss Roxy's feelings and that's
partly the reason she's so unhappy, and
oughtn't you to be perfectly sure that
Mr. Hunt isn't playing with yours before you
give away any clothes?"
</p>

<p>
"That was very thoughtful of you,
Rebecca," commented Persis approvingly.
"And what did she say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  She fell into her rocking-chair and
laughed and laughed till the tears rolled
down her cheeks.  Then she stood up and
took the dress right off her back and kissed
the waist of it and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Emma Jane's china-blue eyes were popping
out of her head.  Her mind was hurrying
to keep up with Rebecca's tale, but it
seemed half a league behind as she
ejaculated: "Kissed her waist?  Wha' for?"
</p>

<p>
Rebecca looked embarrassed, both at the
interruption at the high-water mark of her
story and at the lack of comprehension.
Also, it was a difficult action to explain in
words; one whose meaning was to be felt with
a blush and a heartbeat, but not dragged
into the open and enlarged upon in bald
speech.
</p>

<p>
"Just think it over, Emma Jane, for I
can't talk about it," she said.  "If you'd
only read 'Ivanhoe,' as I wanted you to,
or even 'Cora, the Doctor's Wife' or 'The
Pearl of Orr's Island,' you'd know lots more
about things."
</p>

<p>
"I know!" cried Candace triumphantly.
"She'd had on the dress when he asked her
to marry him, and she loved it."
</p>

<p>
"I can see how she'd kiss him, but I'd
never 'a' thought of her kissin' a waist!"
murmured Emma Jane obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she did!" Rebecca went on with
heightened color.  "She kissed it more'n
twenty times as quick as lightning and hung
it up in the closet, and then she laughed
and cried some more and said: 'Oh, Rebecca,
if you only knew how sure I am that
Mr. Hunt isn't playing with my feelings; but I
must tell him about your warning!  Here,
dear,' she said, rolling the skirt into a
bundle, 'you'll have to piece the breadths
to make them long enough, but feather-stitching
will cover the seams and, oh!  I
want to give it away right now when it's just
warm with gladness and let it go to poor
Miss Roxy, who hasn't got a splendid man
to love her and take care of her like my
Robert!'&mdash;that's what she called him."
Rebecca's voice broke; her eyes glistened;
her cheeks glowed.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the little group of budding
women all felt vague thumpings and stirrings
of something on the left side that
had heretofore been silent.  "Well, I
declare!"  "How perfectly elegant!"  "Isn't it
sweet of her!"  "And now we've got our
lining that's worried us the most."  "And
it's just fallen from heaven like the manna
in the Bible!"
</p>

<p>
"And how wonderful to have a happiness
lining all ready to put in our happiness quilt,
the first happiness quilt that ever was!  It
simply must make a little difference in Miss
Roxy's feelings!"
</p>

<p>
"And to think that we're the only ones
in Riverboro to know that teacher's engaged
to be married!  It'll be all over the village
to-morrow, and we knew it first!  Oh, Rebecca,
it's been the most wonderful meeting
we've ever had, and when we see a pink
tape on your pigtail again we'll run harder
than ever!"
</p>

<p>
These and a dozen other excited comments
fell from the girls' lips as they made
their way home from the pine-grove meeting.
</p>

<p>
The collecting of the happiness pieces did
not turn out to be a task of insuperable
difficulty.  The children themselves
furnished a goodly number.  There were some
scraps of Rebecca's pink gingham, her first
dress of the color she adored but had never
hitherto possessed, having worn out her
sister Hannah's clothes ever since she was
born.  Emma Jane gave bits of her Scotch
plaid poplin, called the handsomest dress
ever worn in Riverboro's younger set.  There
were squares from frocks in which Persis
and Candace had received school prizes and
Alice Robinson had worn in tableaux.
Alice was always in tableaux on account of
her pink-and-white skin and golden hair,
and was always cast for "the angel,"
although she had a most uncertain disposition.
</p>

<p>
The minister's wife, confidentially consulted,
had contributed the full sleeves and
shoulder cape of the dress she "appeared
bride in" the Sunday after her wedding.
</p>

<p>
"I had to walk up the aisle and sit in my
pew all alone that summer, Rebecca, and I
was only seventeen," she said.  "Sometimes
I thought it would be nice to be married to
just a man that belonged to me only, and
have him sit beside me in meeting; but then
I remembered how grateful I ought to be
that my husband belonged to God."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Jane gave two squares of the
cherry-colored glacé silk that she wore when she
danced with the Governor of Maine at an
inauguration ball at Augusta.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Miranda never knew that the quilt
had any sentimental notions worked into
it or she would have thrown cold water on
the entire proposition; but in her ignorance
she looked over her piece-bag one rainy
afternoon with Rebecca.  Suddenly she
chanced upon a bit of dun-colored stuff
that resembled hair-cloth in texture.
</p>

<p>
"There!" she exclaimed.  "That was the
best dress I ever had!  It wore me like iron!
I put two braids on the bottom of it the
fourth year and new under-arm pieces the
next spring, and I believe it lasted me nine
seasons.  I never had so much comfort out
of anything as that dress!  It's a pleasure to
look back upon!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you look nice in it, Aunt Miranda?"
Rebecca inquired with interest.
</p>

<p>
"I don' know's I ever noticed," her aunt
replied absent-mindedly.  "I know it covered
me up, an' that's what dresses are for,
I guess."
</p>

<p>
"Can I have a piece of it and one of
your gray cashmere, too?" asked Rebecca;
and as she put it in her sewing basket she
thought: "I wonder if Aunt Miranda never
came any closer to happiness than that!"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
I am afraid that from an artistic standpoint
the quilt of happiness was not a very
handsome one.  The idea having been the most
important thing in the working-out of
the design, every conceivable kirjd of stuff
had been employed&mdash;calico, gingham, silk,
poplin, percale, alpaca, Henrietta cloth,
delaine, velveteen, challie, and cashmere;
but the squares had been combined with
such loving care that the effect was gay and
attractive, if a little bizarre.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, the very angels themselves
might have been pleased to look down on
the five bright heads&mdash;yellow, chestnut,
auburn, and brown&mdash;that bent every day
over their self-imposed task!
</p>

<p>
There were five lame middle fingers
aching from the pressure of brass thimbles,
and five forefingers pricked wkh needle
marks, but there were no complaints.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca's energy flagged now and then,
for long and monotonous tasks were not her
strong point; and, if it had not been a quilt
of happiness, her share in it might never have
been accomplished.  It was just a little girl's
dream&mdash;rainbow-tinted, fanciful, baseless;
but it danced in and out of the patchwork
squares like a vagrant summer breeze, and
somehow it danced through the heart, too,
ripening and sweetening it.
</p>

<p>
And at last, in late November, there came
a day of days when, in an empty chamber
at Emma Jane's house (Miranda Sawyer
had refused to have the girls bringing in dirt
and carrying it up and down the stairs of
the brick house), Mrs. Perkins and Aunt
Jane stretched the quilt into its frame,
suspended on the backs of four wooden chairs.
Miss Dearborn, who grew prettier every
day and came from the post-office in the
afternoons all smiles and beams and dimples,
had made the happiness lining herself and
featherstitched the seams.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Perkins, whose father had been a
storekeeper, leaving her enormous riches in
the shape of new goods, brought from her
attic her contribution of rolls of sheet
wadding.
</p>

<p>
Now the outside, the wadding, and the
lining were held carefully in place by hands
that were moist with excitement and
responsibility, and the tacking of the three
smoothly together with bright-colored
worsteds proved to be the most difficult task
that the girls had yet confronted.
</p>

<p>
There was a week's work in all this, and
two or three afternoons when the binding
of the four long sides was done; but, by dint
of perseverance, the last stitch was put into
the quilt on the day before Christmas, when
Aunt Jane had prophesied New Year's as
the nearest possible date of completion.
The girls gazed at their work with
uncontrollable admiration and reverence.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick to death of it!" exclaimed
Rebecca.  "I love it to distraction, and I never
want to see another as long as I live!  How
can anybody make 'em for fun?  I could hug
it, I'm so fond of it, and slap it, I'm so tired
of it!" And the girls echoed her sentiments,
though in less picturesque and vigorous language.
</p>

<p>
"If we give it to her to-day, she'll have
something to be thankful for on Christmas
Day," the girls decided.  "We'll have to lug
it up together, and let Rebecca go in with it,
while we stay out in the road and wait."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say 'lug,' and let's go after dark,"
Rebecca suggested.  "I believe I can open
the door and put it down softly in, the entry
with our letter; then I won't get thanked all
by myself, which wouldn't be fair; and we
can take turns going up to-morrow to hear
what she says."
</p>

<p>
"Mother's going to send her a big plate
of dinner," said Alice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, joy!" And Rebecca took out the
pink tape from her apron pocket and tied it
on a pigtail.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" the girls asked breathlessly
in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Why, once there was a very important
paper that had to be sent to a certain king
by one of his1 generals, and he stationed
messengers ten miles apart all along the road
from his camp to the king's palace.  One
man galloped for ten miles, got off his hot,
steaming charger and handed the message to
another man, who was all ready and waiting
on a fresh horse.  He galloped on to the next
man, and so on.  We'll do the same with
Miss Roxy's dinner, each of us making
believe it's horseback, and running like mad to
give the basket to the next one.  Then it'll
get there piping hot!"
</p>

<p>
Christmas Eve fell cold and bleak, with a
north wind and an uncertain moon.  The
girls put on mittens and hoods and, starting
at six o'clock, whem it was quite dark, they
carried the quilt as they walked, Indian
file, along the frozen road.  They met no one,
just as they had planned, for as the affair
had begun in secrecy, so it was hoped to end
it.  That was half the fun.
</p>

<p>
The Simpson cottage, with its yard
completely filled with ramshackle vehicles
and cast-off implements of every sort, was
lighted by the effulgence of the tall banquet
lamp that Rebecca and Emma Jane had
earned as a premium for selling soap.  It
was the joy and pride of the Simpsons,
although as drawing-room furniture it was
accompanied only by a battered pine table
and three rickety wooden chairs.
</p>

<p>
The girls admired its glow in passing, but
kept on the dark side of the road and went
stealthily by to avoid being hailed by Clara
Belle Simpson.  Midway up the lane four of
them stayed behind a clump of young pines
while Rebecca went on alone, staggering
under the weight of the precious quilt.
</p>

<p>
It was cold and the teeth of the "waiters"
chattered, but by dint of walking round and
round the trees they succeeded in keeping
fairly comfortable, as their blood was
circulating with incredible rapidity and they
were palpitating with excitement.
</p>

<p>
Soon Rebecca came running lightly down
the lane.  "Wait till we get into the road,"
she whispered, "and I'll tell you all, though
everything went just right.  Now come close
and keep walking.  I looked through the
kitchen window and saw a lamp burning on
the table, but nobody there.  Then I opened
the front door softly and went in on tiptoe,
thinking Miss Roxy was upstairs or down
cellar, and that I'd put the quilt on a chair
with our letter.  But the door was open into
the kitchen chamber and I could see her
there asleep.  She hadn't gone to bed for
good, I guess, because she wasn't undressed.
She was lying there with her gray shawl and
a black jacket over her shoulders, and her
father's soldier coat over her feet.  Then I
had an idea!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" they laughed in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"So I crept in like a mouse, lifted off the
coat and jacket ver-y softly, and spread the
quilt over her!"
</p>

<p>
Here Rebecca's emotion quite overcame
her.  She stopped still in the road and clasped
her hands dramatically, while the girls
listened with devouring eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said under her breath.  "If
only you had all been there!  The quilt was
beautiful beyond compare!  Miss Roxy
looked like a queen in it, spread all over
everything&mdash;so big, so thick, so rich and
bright!  Her face was as white as her hair,
and her eyes were shut tight.  I tiptoed
out, so afraid she'd wake up and have to
thank nie.  But it seemed to me I must go
back once, to see if she had moved, and take
one last look; so I crept round to the back
and peeped in the window.  Just then she
put out her hand and I thought she'd feel
something strange and open her eyes, but
she didn't.  She just pulled it up round her
neck; then she snuggled down into it the
way you do when you know you're going to
sleep that instant minute and have a lovely
dream.  And then the moon came out and
shone on her face, so I can't be perfectly
certain, though I was looking hard, but I
think, I really do think, that she smiled."
</p>

<p>
Here Rebecca stopped suddenly, turned
her head away and swallowed a lump that
appeared unexpectedly in her throat.
</p>

<p>
Emma Jane, who adored her, pressed her
arm fondly but uncomprehendingly.
</p>

<p>
"You are the queerest!" she exclaimed.
"I never saw anybody before who cried
when she was pleased!"
</p>

<p>
Rebecca, all smiles again, dashed away
the coming tear.
</p>

<p>
"I've told you before, Emma Jane," she
said," that you'd know lots of things if only
you'd read books.  'Cora, the Doctor's Wife'
and 'The Pearl of Orr's Island' always cried
when they were happy.  I feel as if laughs
and cries came out of the same spot inside
of me!"
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was right and the moon told the
truth.  Miss Roxy had smiled, and she had
dreamed.  Dreams were rare occurrences
in her experience, for her nights were as
drab and colorless as her days.  The dream
carried her so far into the past that she was
a child again; and the something warm that
she felt about her neck was her sister's
arm&mdash;the sister she loved best of all.

<h3>
MATT MILLIKEN'S IMPROVEMENTS
</h3>

<p>
The teacher of the Riverboro district school
sat behind her desk, correcting compositions.
The twenty-eight pupils, varying in age from
four to fifteen, had departed, and Undine
Berry had opened the windows wide in order
that the last trace of them should be
dispersed.  Each separate pupil was a clean,
healthy, country girl or boy, but collectively
they exhaled an odor of muddy shoes and
rubbers, lead and slate pencils, concealed
doughnuts or cookies, peppermint lozenges,
boxes of angleworms for bait, and other
necessary accompaniments to the acquisition
of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
There was room for occasional discouragement
on the part of a district school-teacher
in a small Maine village.  Out of Undine's
twenty-eight there were nine to be taught
their "letters."  There was a group
struggling in arithmetic from fractions to
percentage; there were toilers in the labyrinths
of grammar, but Undine's task to-day was
more than usually exasperating, for the
superintendent had put a new plan in operation
with a view of obtaining better results
in the way of compositions.
</p>

<p>
"If the children understand fully what
they read, Miss Berry, they will be better
able to write freely, when the occasion
comes.  For next week's compositions, Miss
Berry, instead of calling upon them for
creative work, give them fifteen minutes
without previous notice, and ask them to
write from memory any verses they have
read or recited this term.  You will then
discover the influence of certain poems upon
their imagination and be able to tell how
correctly they can recall them for you."
</p>

<p>
The acid test had been applied that day,
and the disheveled results were on the desk
in front of the teacher, whose glance was
directed to the few lines contributed by a
certain freckle-faced Tommy Mixter, who
was perhaps the sharpest and most active
thorn in Miss Berry's tender flesh.  Tommy's
half-hour of agonized effort had produced
this brief and inspired result:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
  Lines to a Frinjed Water Foul<br>
  I tear her teetered end side down!<br>
</p>

<p class="letter">
Dear Teacher.
</p>

<p class="letter">
This is all I can remember of it though
I liked the peace when Jim Thompson
resited it.  TOMMY.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Undine Berry had no sense of humor, or
this gem would have given her sufficient joy
to last through the afternoon; she was only
irritated that such dullness could exist in any
human being.  Had not the stirring lines
of "Old Ironsides" been recited on three
successive Fridays?  Had not Jim Thompson
roared, "Aye! tear her tattered ensign
down!" with appropriate gestures and been
loudly applauded?  Had she not explained
what an ensign was, and that "Ay" was
pronounced like "I" and "Aye" like "A"?
</p>

<p>
The teacher glanced out of the window
now and then, noting in the distance a little
cottage covered with vines and a
somewhat-too-stout young man working in a flower
garden.  Some of the fragrant products of
his growing were in a tumbler on her desk
at the present moment, having been plucked
by his own hand, tied neatly with twine,
protected by a portion of the Lewiston
<i>Journal</i>, and sent by the hand of the aforesaid
Tommy, whose outward mien was respectful,
but who declared in secret conclave that
Matt Milliken was "stuck on teacher."
</p>

<p>
Undine herself was distinctly aware of
this fact, but she was so discreet, so
impartial, in her treatment of Riverboro's
masculine eligibles&mdash;above all, so uncertain
of her own attitude in this particular
matter&mdash;that the coupling of her name with
that of Matt Milliken had never been heard,
even by the school committee.
</p>

<p>
"To be Mrs. Matthew Milliken is one
thing," thought Undine as she moved her
chair out of sight of the young gardener,
who was doing more gazing than weeding,
"but what would they say at home in
Greenford if I married a farmer in a
one-horse village?  I wonder if he'd be able to
keep a hired girl for me.  If I had to cook
three meals a day and wash dishes the rest
of the time, I might as well teach school,
though goodness knows that's a dog's life!&mdash;I'd
like to put these compositions in the
stove and set a match to them!  Even after
they are corrected, I've got to study three
pages of geometry to keep ahead of Jim
Thompson.  The good scholars are a sight
more trouble than the stupid ones, after all."
</p>

<p>
She could bear her work no longer, and
opening the desk to fling in the offending
papers, she closed it with a bang, shook the
dust of toil from her white dress, put on her
broad-brimmed hat and white silk gloves,
took a green parasol from the closet, locked
the school door behind her thankfully, and
strolled away on her homeward walk to
Mrs. Wilkins's boarding-house.
</p>

<p>
She had to pass the Millikens' cottage.
There was no other way to go; the most
determined gossip would allow that.  And
everybody knew that Matthew had always
worked in the flower garden just before
supper-time.  She supposed he had other
duties, but at all events, between nine and
four he was always in his garden, on his
front steps, sitting in his open barn door, or
washing the top buggy which to her was
one of his greatest attractions.
</p>

<p>
As she drew nearer now, she could see him
wipe his forehead, pull down his vest, and
brush the dirt from his hands.  Then he came
toward the gate and leaned over it with a
pink cabbage rose in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"How'll that do to put in your belt?" he
asked genially.  "Looks to me as if it had
growed a-purpose for that partic'ler
spot."  There was open, almost violent admiration
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Milliken, it's lovely; and
I must thank you, too, for the sweet peas
you sent me by Tommy this morning.  They
look so nice on my desk.  I've had rather a
hard day."
</p>

<p>
"I bet you have!" Matt responded fervently.
"Landsakes!  I'd rather lay bricks
for a livin' than ram book-learnin' into that
set o' kids.  I'd learn 'em with a switch if
I was the teacher!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't need any switch to keep
order," said Undine sweetly.  "I'm supposed
to be rather good at discipline."
</p>

<p>
"I bet you be!  Some o' the teachers suits
the parents, and others suits the children.
You 'pear to have 'em both under control.
The little ones like to look at you same as
they would a picture-book, an' the big boys
would lay right down an' let you tread on
'em."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad if it seems that way."  This
was said with touching modesty.  "Of
course I couldn't manage those great, strong
boys by force."
</p>

<p>
"You bet you couldn't!  We had a husky
young college feller teachin' here last year,
and the boys fit him the whole time&mdash;lockin'
him out o' the schoolhouse, hidin'
his hat, havin' coughin' spells in study hour,
stuffin' the stove pipe with hay, and the land
knows what!  He's given up teachin' now
an' is trainin' for nurse in a lunatic asylum.
Says he knows what he's up against and
likes the work better."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't care to have anything to do
with crazy folks," remarked Undine sententiously.
</p>

<p>
Matt laughed, showing his handsome
teeth.  "You may have to, first thing you
know, for everybody round here is crazy
about you, though they ain't gone to
asylums yet!"
</p>

<p>
Undine could do no less than smile and
blush at such a neat compliment.  "It's a
real nice place, Riverboro; the people are so
pleasant."
</p>

<p>
"You like it, do you?" asked Matt with
obvious eagerness.
</p>

<p>
Undine cooled suddenly.  "Oh, yes!  But
I'm real quick at making myself at home
wherever I am.  I have to be, to get any
variety out of life.  Of course I can't afford
to teach in such a small place as this very
long."
</p>

<p>
Matt's face suddenly clouded.  "I didn't
think of that," he said, taking off his hat.
"It is a small place for such as you, and I
suppose Greenford is a real gay town&mdash;sociables,
dances, and all that sort of thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Greenford is considered very lively,
and there's a great deal of wealth there&mdash;the
cotton mills, you know.  Then I often
go to Portland and Brunswick."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Milliken suddenly appeared at the
screen door.  "Good-afternoon, Miss Berry.
I'm baking a little something for supper
and can't leave my oven.  The kitchen's so
hot I won't ask you inside, but if you an'
Matthew'll set down under the big ellum,
I'll bring you both out a try-cake in a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Milliken, but I'm
afraid I ought to be going.  I'll be late to
supper, as it is."
</p>

<p>
"You just set right down," called
Mrs. Milliken, "an' I'll show you a one-egg cake
that'll deceive you into thinkin' it's made
with four, if it's et hot.  Then Matt'll walk
down as fur as the store with you and bring
me back a can of baking-powder."
</p>

<p>
"He might as well see all there is to see in
her, and know all there is to know, which is
mighty little, or I miss my guess!" said the
old lady to herself as she took a straw out of
the broom to try the cake.  "Mebbe then
he'll get her out of his system; though them
pink and white paper-doll girls do have a
way of keepin' holt of men-folks."
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later Matthew and Undine
were walking down the hill while
Mrs. Milliken watched them from behind the
parlor curtains.
</p>

<p>
Undine Berry was a beauty, there was
no denying that!  Her hair was spun gold,
breaking into bewitching little waves and
curls round her temples, her ears, and the
nape of her neck.  Her skin was perfect, her
hands and feet small, her figure lovely.  A
person (female) intent upon finding flaws
would have said her features were rather
immature and meaningless and that her eyes,
though of heaven's own blue in color, were
a little cold and calculating, but Matthew
Milliken saw no flaws.  He thought of her as
something so exquisite that he would have
liked to put her under a glass case on his
parlor melodeon.  If only he could get far
enough in friendship to fathom her likes and
dislikes, her desires, her ambitions, so that
he might guess whether there was any
chance for a clumsy creature like himself to
win her love!  But he scarcely knew how to
set about such a task.  Every time he
advanced, she seemed to retreat a little to
fastnesses of thought where he was not at
home.
</p>

<p>
"Some folks don't seem to hold up their
heads before the public nor care how their
buildings look," Undine commented severely,
as they passed a poor little house,
forlorn, unpainted, lacking clapboards and
shingles.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a man has got to have a little
money saved up, have good health, and work
night and day to keep up his farm nowadays,"
said Matthew.  "If my father hadn't
left me an awful good piece of land, forty
acres of it, with fifteen in woodland, as well
as something to go on with till I was big
enough to take hold for myself, I don't
know how I'd 'a' come out&mdash;and my place
isn't rightly kep' up, either; I know it.  I
intend to begin improvin' it this summer.
I've got a man comin' to work through
hayin' time, I'll get skilled help inside, and
you'll see a reg'lar palace when you come
back, Undine&mdash;<i>There!</i>"&mdash;and he checked
himself and grew red in the face, as he
added: "Your front name slipped out before
I thought.  I suppose you wouldn't let me
call you 'Undine,' would you, Miss Berry?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think it would sound quite
proper, Mr. Milliken&mdash;at any rate, in
public.  You see, people might talk, and
other young men would be asking the same
privilege.  I always think it makes a girl
appear sort of common, corresponding with
gentlemen, giving away her photographs,
and being called by her first name on a few
weeks' acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"Would you feel the same about calling
me 'Matthew,' if there wasn't anybody
'round?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"To tell the truth, I don't feel as if we'd
been friends long enough for me to call you
'Matthew'&mdash;yet&mdash;Mr. Milliken.  I am
so unlike other girls.  Sometimes I wish I
wasn't.  I am so reserved, so unsuited to the
life I'm living.  Mother says she must have
guessed what I was going to be like when
she named me Undine."
</p>

<p>
They were leaning over the bridge-rail
now, looking into the foamy rapids of the
Saco, as thousands of other young couples
had leaned and looked in all the years since
the river began to run.
</p>

<p>
"Most everybody round here is named
out of the Bible," said Matthew.  "Look at
our neighborhood.  There's Mark Hobson,
Luke Dunn, John Briggs, and me to
represent the apostles; there's a Samuel, a
Josiah, a David, an Elijah, and a Jeremiah,
an' by George! there's a Sarah, a Naomi, an'
a Rachel!  I looked through the Old Testament
last evening to find your name, but I
couldn't!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" said Undine, in a tone conveying
her idea that the Bible was a rather
second-class source for names.  "I was
called Undine out of a fairy story that
everybody was reading when mother was a girl.
Undine was not a real woman, she was a
water-sprite, and a knight named Lord
Huldbrand found her standing in a brook
in the forest and fell in love with her.  She
had been found on the river bank and
brought up by a fisherman and his wife.  She
loved the knight and married him, and after
a long time she turned from a water-sprite
into a woman, for love had given her a soul!"
</p>

<p>
Here the narrator's blue eyes tried to
convey mysterious things to the bridge-rail,
over which they were thoughtfully bent.
"It is a beautiful story.  I'll lend it to you
if you like."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't much of a reader, but I want that
book as quick as I can get it.  Can I come
over to-morrow?  I can't hardly take it in
at first hearin', but I want to understand
everything you do, and think, and feel,
Undine.  I want&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There would have been an offer of marriage
on the bridge at that moment, had
not Jim Thompson approached swiftly and
hung over the rail beside them in friendly
fashion, confident&mdash;being young and
artless&mdash;of a hearty welcome.
</p>

<p>
Undine was distinctly grateful for the
interruption, for she was not in the least ready
to say yes or no to the question of all
questions, so she bade Matthew good-night with
a smile that almost overthrew his reason,
and hastened home to supper.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Matthew, forgetting the
baking-powder, hurried back to his mother,
went to the pasture for the cows, milked
them, set the milk in the dairy, and then
stalking into the kitchen where Mrs. Milliken
was scalding the pails and pans, called out,
</p>

<p>
"Say!  Where's the dictionary, mother?"
</p>

<p>
"On the top shelf of the china closet in
the dining-room, where it was when your
father died.  I guess nobody ever has took it
down since."
</p>

<p>
Matthew found the book, brought it back
to a chair under the light, and began to turn
the pages.  "Gosh!" he ejaculated.  "I guess
I ain't looked in it sence I left school."
</p>

<p>
"What word is it you want, Matthew?"
</p>

<p>
"Water-sprite.  Will it be under 'water'
or 'sprite,' do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know how to spell and define
water fast enough.  Why don't you look
under '<i>s</i>' for sprite?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you spell it?  I can't find it.
Mebbe the dictionary's too old."
</p>

<p>
"It's Webster, Matthew.  Webster don't
age, at least any to hurt.  I suppose it's
s-p-r-i-g-h-t, ain't it, like light and sight and
might and fight?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't seem to be here," said Matthew.
"What is a water-sprite, mother, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, my son, but I should surmise
it's a kind of bug that breeds in the
water."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you guess wrong, for Undine
Berry's mother named her out of a fairy
story, and Undine was a water-sprite and
no bug!  Here it is, now.  It ain't spelled like
'fight,' it is 's-p-r-i-t-e,' and it means a
'spirit.'"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't they call it so, then?" asked
Mrs. Milliken.  "Everybody knows 'spirit'
an' nobody ever heard o' 'sprite'!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've learned something new,
anyway, mother.  I tell you a dictionary is a
great book, and I'm going to keep it on the
parlor table from now on."
</p>

<p>
"Not on the marble-top, Matt, for the
table is dreadful weak in the legs.  You don't
seem to get time to do chores in the house
this summer.  The tall clock don't strike
right, the west window in the parlor won't
open good, and there's a pane o' glass
broken."
</p>

<p>
"I've been too busy with the garden and
my barn work, and I ain't felt so lively as
common," apologized Matt, "but I'm goin'
to turn over a new leaf and start right in
improvin' this place.  We've got money in
the bank and plenty of timber big enough to
sell, with a lot o' young growth comin' on
besides, and there ain't any reason why we
shouldn't put on a little mite o' style.  I'd
like some fresh paint inside and out,
new-fashioned wall-paper, and water brought into
the kitchen from the well&mdash;that much for a
start, and more as I get goin' and can see
how I can improve."
</p>

<p>
"I think that's a good plan, Matthew,"
said his mother, who was knitting quietly
in her rocker.  "And while the house is
all upside down and workmen in it, why
couldn't I go and make Lorenzo and Lulu
a little visit in Vermont?  Could you spare
me all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I could!  Maria Snow would come
in and clear me up once a week and cook
me a batch of victuals, and I could go to
Mrs. Wilkins's and get a meal now and then;
she's taking transients.  I've got Bill Benson
comin' Monday to help with milkin' and
hayin', you know, but he can board himself.
I'll sleep in the shed-chamber while you're
gone, so the workmen can have a free hand.
Jiminy, mother, we'll give a jamboree after
harvestin'!  I declare I'm all het up over the
idea of our improvements."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I only hope they'll turn out to be
improvements," his mother answered
serenely.  "Anyhow you're a young man and
likely to live in the house the rest of your
life.  You'd ought to have it to suit you,
Matthew, and make it nice for a wife and
children in comin' years."
</p>

<p>
Matthew blushed to the roots of his hair,
and as he took his candle and started for the
back stairs, he turned and said, like a shy
schoolboy: "I was kind o' thinkin' o' them
myself, mother, that's the truth.  Though,"
he added with a laugh, "I don't know
exactly who they be, nor what they'll look
like."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Milliken locked the shed door,
turned out the lamp, then lighted her own
candle preparatory to going to her little
bedroom opening out of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"I guess the man that wrote, 'They also
serve who only stand and wait,' knew
something about mothers!" she said to herself.
</p>

<p>
Matthew, young, strong, big-hearted,
simple-minded, was asleep as soon as his
head touched the pillow.  His waking hours
were filled with certain confusions and
perplexities, but these vanished in sleep, and his
dreams were rose-colored, for he was utterly
in love, and with an angel.
</p>

<p>
Tommy Mixter, aged twelve, at this moment
the life and soul of a clump of small
boys on the loafers' bench at the Riverboro
end of the bridge, knew Undine Berry better
than Matthew Milliken did, but Tommy
was too young to be smitten by feminine
beauty, and he was a keen judge of
character.  His ears had been snapped by Miss
Berry's thumb and finger more than once,
and he particularly disliked the way her lips
were set when she called him up to ferrule
him in the face of the whole school.
</p>

<p>
"For nothin' at all, neither," he was wont
to say.  "O' course she ain't got strength
enough to hurt a skeeter, an' her dress is so
tight she don't dass put on any steam for
fear she'll bust it, but she'd lam you good if
she knew how!  Matt Milliken will be toein'
the mark himself by fall, an' I won't have
to lug any more o' his flowers to the next
teacher, that's one good thing!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Undine prepared herself for bed that
night with a trifle more care than usual,
punctuating each move in the operation
by long studies of her charming self in the
looking-glass, which was of poor quality
and never did her entire justice.  Her hair
was the first subject of admiration, as she
brushed the golden mop and held it up to
glow in the full light of her kerosene lamp.
</p>

<p>
"It might land me 'most anywheres, my
hair," she thought, "even in the moving
pictures.  They say a star can get along
without any talent if she has the right kind of
hair and wears her clothes well.  I never had
a chance to try on handsome dresses, but I
guess my shape is as good as any of the stars
I've seen.  And my face wouldn't need any
smoothing out nor touching up, for it's
worrying that makes wrinkles, and I never
was a worrier.  Let other folks do the
worrying, is my motto."
</p>

<p>
Undine, as she looked admiringly at her
hair and skin and figure with the aid of a
hand mirror, never once discovered that her
nose was just the least little bit inclined to
be flat.  Her lips were red, but the line of her
mouth had no lovable, generous curves.
Her eyes were so blue that they rivaled
sapphires, but they never suffused with
tears, nor danced with merry sparkles of fun,
nor looked deep, deep into other eyes,
revealing all sorts of true, tender, unspeakable
things.  No, her eyes were a magnificent color
and would last her to a good old age, but
she would never see visions with them.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless there was something in
Matthew Milliken's personality that threatened
the heretofore dominating influence of
life, as it was lived in moving pictures.  His
youthful strength and manly presence stirred
her heart just a trifle, and also his obvious
passion for her had its effect.
</p>

<p>
There had been a moment that afternoon
when she, who was ordinarily so self-centered,
could not help noticing how the dog
nestled his nose softly into Matt's hand;
how the cat kept creeping round his legs,
hunching its back and rubbing its ears till
it got the stroke under the chin that it was
wishing for; how the Jerseys came up to the
bars to greet him.  She had once seen him at
milking time and noted how still the cows
stood in the stalls, giving their milk tranquilly
at the touch of his steady, kind hands.
Yes, he would be good to live with, but
he didn't dress well and looked worse on
Sundays than he did in his working clothes.
She liked the things he said, and the way
he looked at her and complimented her, but
there were sad lapses in his grammar.  And
how would he appear in company, if she
succeeded in dragging him away from this
one-horse village and establishing him where
her beauty would have a larger audience?
</p>

<p>
She didn't know; she could not be sure.
Why was it that a really "stylish" man
from a large city never came across her path?
If one ever did arrive, she felt sure that her
heart, which had never in its life beat faster
than normal, might carry her to a swift, sure
decision.  Meantime she was twenty and
would soon be "walking down the western
slopes of life," Mrs. Wilkins's metaphor for
unmarried ladies over five and twenty.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I fear I shan't be able to stave
Matt off till the end of the term," thought
Undine.  "That's what I'd rather do, for
I'm certain to spend part of my vacation in
Portland, where I always meet good society,
and one can never tell what will happen.  I
don't want to see too much of him for fear
I'll get to liking him and won't be able to
settle matters for my best good.  I wonder
if his mother supposes I don't see through
her and her 'try-cakes'?  She hates me like
poison, that woman does, because she
knows I wouldn't fetch and carry for Matt
the way she does!"
</p>

<p>
These reflections concluded, Undine went
to bed and slept peacefully.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
June was a trying month that year.  The
weather was unusually warm, and an
outbreak of measles among the children
interfered with Undine's preparations for the
last day of school.  She had several drives
and moonlight walks with Matthew Milliken,
and she had nearly succeeded in keeping
him within bounds.
</p>

<p>
As she had perfect command of herself,
and as he was simply dumb with love&mdash;shy,
too, and full of fears at putting his fate
to the touch too soon&mdash;he had not been
able to speak his heart out and ask her
"punctilió"&mdash;a favorite word of his
mother's&mdash;if she would marry him in the autumn.
He had awakened every morning determined
to do it, and he had gone to bed every
night without having succeeded.  He assured
himself that he had made some little headway
on certain occasions that he recalled
with burning cheeks in the solitude of his
own room.  He had held her hand for several
minutes once when they were sitting under
the pines on the river bank, but his
enjoyment had been sadly incomplete, because
he had been terror-stricken every second for
fear she would take it away.  He had been
obliged to make the move himself finally
because of the arrival of a large picnic party,
the members of which he still regarded with
fierce animosity.
</p>

<p>
Then&mdash;oh, never-to-be-forgotten moment
of supreme bliss!&mdash;with a courage
born of despair he had kissed her on
Mrs. Wilkins's steps after Wednesday evening
prayer-meeting.  If she had not returned the
caress as fully as he could have wished, at
least she had not withdrawn herself in
anger.  It was at that moment that, made
more daring by the remembrance that she
was leaving the village for her vacation, he
pleaded:
</p>

<p>
"Undine, haven't I waited long enough
for an answer?  I can't expect you to love
me as I love you, but just give me a word to
live on till you come back!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't hardly know what to say," she
murmured, reaching up to see if she had
lost her pearl earring.  "I like you better
than anybody I've ever seen, but I wish
you'd let me think it over these next two
months.  I'm not sure I'm fitted to be a
farmer's wife.  I've never done any housework,
you know, Matthew."
</p>

<p>
Oh! how fragile, how plaintive, how in
need of all a man's strength she looked in
the moonlight!
</p>

<p>
"Why, Undine, do you s'pose I'd let you
spoil your pretty hands with rough work?
I'll always be there to stand between you
and the hard parts, and you shall have a
hired girl to wait on you every minute of
the day.  Besides, you don't know the
improvements I'm going to make in my
premises.  The house is going to beat anything
there is in Riverboro or Edgewood.  While
I'm gettin' ready for you, Undine, won't you
be gettin' ready for me?"
</p>

<p>
"You domineering man, you!" she whispered,
playing with the lapels of his coat,
"teasing me into saying 'yes' against my
will!  I suppose you must go ahead with
your improvements and let me see them
when I come back.  I am sure it'll be all
right!"
</p>

<p>
"Seal your promise with a kiss?" Matthew
whispered, and it is difficult to see how
Undine could have evaded the direct issue,
even had she wished, had not Mrs. Wilkins,
opening a window, called out,
</p>

<p>
"The door-key is under the rug, Undine."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Matthew, who was concealed
by the thick foliage of the maples, opened
the gate softly and sped homeward on the
wings of love.  She had said to go ahead,
that it would be all right.  That settled it.
</p>

<p>
He had looked forward to another and a
fonder parting when he should take Undine
to the station on Friday, but on Thursday,
when he went rapturously to Biddeford to
engage paperers, painters, and plumbers, the
school committee voted to give up the
closing exercises on account of illness in the
school, and Undine promptly took the train
for Greenford, leaving a note for Matthew
to the effect that she had been called home
suddenly, as her stepfather wanted her to go
to Albany with him on a business trip.
</p>

<p>
This was in the nature of a blow, but only
a slight one, after all, a disappointment that
in no wise affected their relations or their
tacit compact with each other; so Matthew
plunged into a series of fourteen-hour days
of work on his improvements.  No man,
no three men, could keep up with him.  He
was omnipresent and untiring, and the
labor progressed so rapidly that the village
could not restrain its curiosity, all the
gentlemen of leisure passing their time in the
vicinity of the Milliken house, ready to
furnish suggestions or to act as brakes upon
inadvisable changes.
</p>

<p>
Meantime no letters passed between the
lovers save one note from Undine written in
high spirits on the train to Albany.  Matt
had intended to go to Greenford every
second Sunday during the summer, to report
progress and keep the slightly unsteady
flame of her affection from going out.  The
Albany visit put a stop to that, of course,
and he felt a little helpless as the weeks ran
by.  He had not the pen of a ready writer,
and Undine had once said playfully that
she was a bad correspondent and didn't
intend to touch either pen or pencil in
vacation.  Finally Matt spent two hours of
strenuous work with the dictionary and wrote to
his beloved in Greenford with directions to
forward the missive if she were not there.
It was a letter that would have melted a
heart of stone, though viewed as a
composition she would have marked it C4.
</p>

<p>
Then he plunged into the improvements
again.  His mother wrote approval of the
samples of wall-paper he had sent her, and
thanked him for selecting the little gray
trellis pattern with pink roses on it for her
own bedroom, advising him not to work too
hard, for Maria Snow had written he was
looking pale.
</p>

<p>
"I hope he'll look paler still," thought
the crafty old lady, "for that'll mean he
can't get that water-sprite to marry him,
and he'll take sick and want me to come
home to nurse him!"
</p>

<p>
He showed no signs of "taking sick"
however, and it seemed, in his frenzy for
improvements, that the Evil One had
selected him as a victim.  The color of the
new paint on the house did not please a
single inhabitant of the village, and what
was even more regrettable, it did not suit
Matthew himself.  It was far too green, and
the bright yellow blinds suggested by the
artist who was doing the work, were felt by
all to be a public insult.  The fence, too, had
to be of the same colors, either separate or
mixed, as there was plenty of paint for the
purpose, and the scenery in the vicinity, on
a bright day in late August, sank into
insignificance as compared with the Milliken
premises when finished.  The misguided
youth had screened in the little piazza with
wire netting and put a high-power electric
bulb in the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"He ain't intendin' to do no courtin'
there, that's one thing certain," said Maria
Snow.  "I guess he's goin' to read the
Portland papers out loud to Undine summer
evenin's.  He's planned light enough to see
the small print in the telephone directory."
</p>

<p>
He took out the beautiful Colonial front
door with the fanlight over it, always greatly
admired by summer visitors, and installed
one of stained pine with a large square of
glass in it adorned with inside curtains of
Nottingham lace tied back with yellow
ribbons.  That was Maria Snow's idea.
</p>

<p>
"It looks dressy," she said, "and if you're
goin' to keep up with the procession, you've
got to keep up, that's all; though I do think,
Matthew, you might have left your grandfather's
stone steps, if only for the sake of
the old toad that's lived under 'em for fifty
years to my certain knowledge."
</p>

<p>
The stone steps were worn and chipped,
however, and had settled down on one side,
while the path to the front door was not the
kind suitable for high-heeled slippered feet,
so steps and walk were changed to cement,
smooth, dry, and hideously inappropriate
to the little farmhouse.
</p>

<p>
"There's folks say you're goin' to be
married, Matt, with all these
improvements," said Bill one day.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mebbe I be," Matt said laconically,
"and mebbe mother and me are goin' to
take boarders.  The neighbors can take their
choice."
</p>

<p>
Then came a day when the workmen
picked up their tools and left, and Maria
Snow swept and scrubbed and cleaned up
after them, and Matt went out in the barn
and filled his pipe and tilted his chair back
and took an hour to think for the first time
in two months.  For days he had tried the
new kitchen pump every few hours, for Bill
had declared it would never work right,
since the well was ten feet lower than the
sink, and it stood to reason that water
wouldn't run uphill.  This exercise was
varied by the experimental turning on and
off of sixteen electric lights in barn and
house, including the parlor chandelier,
which always had a hypnotic effect on him
when he sat on the haircloth sofa and gazed
fixedly at it for some moments.
</p>

<p>
"I kind o' miss mother's lamp with the
glass danglers and the piece o' red flannin'
in the kerosene," he thought, "but Undine'll
light up something splendid in this room,
so't everybody'll see how han'some she is!"
</p>

<p>
And then he would go out to the barn
again, for there was really nothing to do but
wait.  On the second of September he could
stand the strain no longer.  He must see her
even if he had to go to Albany, where he
had never been invited, and which seemed
to him the Antipodes.  Matt was simple,
there's no denying it.  He trusted anybody
he loved.  She had said go ahead with the
improvements and it would be all right.
She had let him kiss her and hold her hand.
He was so incorrigibly high-minded and so
unversed in worldly wisdom that these facts
simply clinched any arguments that seemed
to point in another direction.  The Committee
expected her to open the school on the
next Monday, and this was a Thursday.
He knew he could not telephone to Greenford
without its being noised about in both
villages, so he took his horse and drove to
Wareham to pay some bills, make some
purchases, and telephone from a drug store
where he wasn't known.  He got the
post-master at Greenford, who said the Berrys
had returned the night before, bringing
company with them, but they didn't
answer the telephone, and he thought they
must be gone off somewhere in their new
motor.
</p>

<p>
This news put Matthew in a panic.  Undine
would be bringing her people over to
Riverboro to see him, and he was away from
home.  He was a merciful driver, but the
horse had to make eleven miles in forty
minutes.  Nearing his house, which was
visible a long distance away, he saw no
sign of activity, no motor in evidence.  The
barn was closed; Bill was not sitting on the
piazza as usual.  He remembered then that
he had sent Bill home for a few days.  He
drove up to the hitching post, tied the horse,
and went up the cement walk so as to get
used to it.  As he neared the steps, he saw an
envelope stuck under the new stained door.
There had never been one there before in all
his twenty-three years of life, never!
</p>

<p>
He knew it had been put there by Undine,
and he knew what was in it.  His was not an
alert mind, and up to this moment he had
not harbored a single suspicion of the girl's
treachery.  He looked long and hard at the
envelope; then he unhitched the horse,
watered and fed him, put him in the stall,
and closed the barn.  He went into the
house through the piazza and the side
entrance, turning the key in the lock behind
him, took off his hat, traveled through the
kitchen and sitting-room to the front hall,
drew the letter from under the front door,
pulled down the green shades in the front
windows, and sat down to read his doom.
He didn't need to be told what was in the
letter.  He merely wanted to know how
Undine put the case; how she apologized
for breaking a man's heart, hurting his
pride, and crushing his spirit.  He tore open
the envelope, and this was what he read:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE, RIVERBORO
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Sept. 2nd, 19&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAR MR. MILLIKEN:
</p>

<p>
I came back to tell the School Committee
that I am not going to teach for them any
more.  I am sorry you happened to be away
in Wareham, for after the superintendent,
I wanted you to be the first to know that I
am engaged to be married to Mr. Arthur
Henderson, a bank clerk in Albany, whom
father and I met while staying at the Dupont
Hotel there.  I didn't write you about it
before because talking is so much more
satisfactory, and I kind of hated to write
anyway, for fear you would blame me for holding
out hopes I could not satisfy.  I really tried
to like you well enough to marry you and
live in Riverboro ["Like!" groaned poor
Matt], but a country place is not to my
taste, and somehow I could not make up my
mind, perhaps because I was never taken off
my feet till I met with Mr. Henderson.  It
was love at first sight on both sides in the
hotel dining-room.
</p>

<p>
I hope you did not consider I had really
promised anything, for you must have seen
I was never crazy about you the way a girl
ought to be when she is meaning to settle
down and marry a man.  Please do not hold
any hard thoughts, for I am not the one for
you, nor you the one for me.  True love has
developed me a great deal and I see things
more clearly than I did last summer.
</p>

<p>
I asked Bill&mdash;don't know his other name&mdash;to
take me over the house, as I thought
you would wish me to see the improvements.
It is not quite so quaint and home-like as
it used to be, but much more convenient.
Screening the piazza is a great help in
keeping out mosquitoes, but yours is a trifle
small, and Bill thinks the wire netting makes
it look like a hen-coop.  Perhaps it does, but
I believe you'll get a great deal of comfort
from it.
</p>

<p>
I am kind of sorry you bricked up the
sitting-room fireplace and put in a Franklin
stove, for the open fire used to look so cozy
last April, do you remember?  The wallpapers
are very handsome, and how your
mother will enjoy the new stove and the
pump in the kitchen sink!  As for the electric
lights, I can fancy how any one will appreciate
them who has filled lamps and cleaned
chimneys all her life.
</p>

<p>
I am mentioning every little thing to show
you how carefully I looked about, for I want
you to feel my interest in it all, even though
I am not going to live there, as we thought
possibly at one time I might.  I have told
Arthur that you were the best friend I had in
Riverboro, and I should have become
homesick and bored to death if it had not been
for your kind little attentions.  I have said
no more about you to him, as, like all true
lovers, he is inclined to be just a little
jealous!  With remembrances to your mother,
and with the compliments of the season,
I am your sincere friend and well-wisher,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
UNDINE BERRY.
</p>

<p>
P.S. If you should ever pass through
Albany, we would like to have you drop in
at the Dupont Hotel, where Arthur has
taken a suite.  The wedding is to-morrow
morning in Greenford, and we leave Maine
the same afternoon.

Matthew tore the letter in bits and, putting
it in the kitchen stove, set fire to the
fragments.  Then he drew down all the
shades so that passers-by in the morning
would think he had gone away for the day.
He did not go upstairs as usual, but went
into his mother's room, impelled by some
blind, unconscious instinct of needing
sympathy.  He opened her closet door and put
his hand gently on the faded gingham dresses
and wrappers she had left behind her.  Then,
turning down her neat white counter-pane
as he had seen her do a hundred times, he
flung himself, still dressed, on her bed and,
turning to her pillow for comfort, said with
a choking voice and a deep-drawn breath,
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, there's always mothers to
fall back on!"
</p>

<p>
It was such a little room, with one window
and all his mother's humble but precious
keepsakes on the bureau and dresser, that it
soothed him, as he lay there alone until he
had struggled with his first sorrow and
overcome it.  After all, he was but a boy of
twenty-three, and he took trouble hard, like
a child.
</p>

<p>
Yes, naturally the affair was a seven days'
wonder in Riverboro, but nobody ever knew
the rights of it.  They thought Matt had
been a trifle reckless about his improvements,
but then he was of marriageable age
and could afford them, though he seemed
to be terribly gloomy about them now they
were all finished.
</p>

<p>
They also thought he might be a little mite
huffy about Undine Berry's taking up with
an Albany man after "going" with him all
summer, but that was nothing but guess-work
and soon passed out of mind.
</p>

<p>
The side of the affair that Matthew
turned toward his mother can best be told
by his own letter to her, which was the
longest one he had ever written in his life.
He posted it on Saturday night at Wareham,
but started for Vermont twenty-four hours
later to bring her home.
</p>

<p>
"You keep house for me, Maria," he said
with a forlorn attempt at gayety.  "Mind
you keep the improvements swept and
dusted, and if the motor folks get too fresh,
write a sign and hang it on the gate.  Make
it read: 'We intended this house to be green.
If it looks too bright to suit you, drive by
fast!'"

RIVERBORO, Sept. 10th, 19&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To MRS. CYRUS MILLIKEN,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warsaw, Vermont<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAR MOTHER:
</p>

<p>
I guess you suspicioned how it was with
Undine and me when you offered to go and
spend the summer with Lorenzo and his
wife in Vermont, and I didn't say nothing
to keep you home.  It wa'n't that I didn't
like to have you round, for I always did,
and you know it, but the way I figured it
out was, I was going to make so many
improvements on the premises that you
wouldn't hardly have a rest for the sole of
your foot and you would be all fussed up
till I got everything to rights.
</p>

<p>
Well, now, mother, I've got to tell you,
nothing has turned out the same as I thought
it would.  Undine gave me to understand
that she liked me first rate, and she knew
well enough that I was fascinated with her
from the minute I set eyes on her.  I could
see she thought the house and barn was kind
of run down and common-looking, and I
figured it out that if I made improvements
enough in the premises and got everything
fixed up fashionable, she'd marry me when
the fall term of school was over.  She was
young and handsome and had more education
than me, and she not being used to
housework, I figured it out that I'd make
things as easy and pleasant for her as I
could, and try to keep up with the band
more than you or I was used to.
</p>

<p>
Well, mother, I was fooled all round, and
I guess I ain't the first man, neither.  My
improvements wouldn't 'a' had any weight
with her, though I'd sweated all summer
over 'em, even working 4th of July and right
through dog-days without hardly sitting
down to a square meal or stopping to change
my shirt.  She'd made up her mind to ship
me even before she seen the cement walk
and the electric lights and the lace curtain
in the front door, which has attracted more
attention than a circus ever sence it was put
in.
</p>

<p>
When we said good-bye, she told me to go
ahead and it would be all right.  I took it as
a sacred promise, and oh, mother, it mortifies
me to confess how clean gone I was on
that girl!  The way it turned out was this:
I got so upset and worried by not hearing
from her by the last of August that I couldn't
stand it any longer.  If she'd stayed to home
in Greenford, I could have drove over every
week or two and kept her up to her word, or
else, though I was blind as a bat, I might
have seen through her; but when I wrote
you all the news in July you remember I
said, "Undine Berry has gone on a visit to
Albany with her father."  Well, she stayed
in Albany, and she didn't correspond with
me but one note and one post-card which
I answered to general delivery, having no
address.  I didn't write her all the grand
things I was doing, because her being a
school-teacher, I figured it out that she'd
catch me up on some mistake in spelling and
turn me down cold.  Well, mother, she done
that anyway all right!
</p>

<p>
I had gone to Wareham to pay bills and
telephone to Greenford where nobody could
hear me asking questions about Undine.
The school committee was expecting her
every train, but she hadn't written to them
for weeks.  Well, mother, I was gone four
hours, and when I come home my heart
sunk right down, for the house looked
strange to me.  I knew something had
happened to the premises and to me, and
sure enough it was so.  I hitched the horse
and went up the cement walk, because
Undine said once a gentleman should use
the front door, and I've done it all summer
for practice.  I always felt like a fool when
I went in that way, and now I've locked it
on the inside.
</p>

<p>
Well, I hadn't taken three steps before I
saw a letter poked under the door, and I
knew it was all up between me and Undine.
I hadn't been looking for it either; it just
come to me in a flash.  I burned up the letter,
but sometime I'll tell you what was in it,
though no other living soul shall ever hear
it, but my heart kind of curled right up
inside of me and ached like it was a tooth.
</p>

<p>
She didn't give me the mitten in a lady-like
way.  She wrote a mean, cruel letter,
mother; the kind that helped me some,
after the first blow.  She's married to an
Albany bank clerk, and they are living in
something she calls a "suite," at a hotel
where a lady never has to go into the
kitchen.  She even had the gall to get Bill
Benson to show her all over the house, and
by Jiminy, she didn't like the improvements
any better than she did me!  I wish
I hadn't burned the letter now, for I kind
o' think I could have laughed over it&mdash;in
a couple o' years.
</p>

<p>
This is an awful long letter, but I'm
giving up all day Sunday to it and probably
shall never write another.  I want you to
know everything, and I guess I couldn't
never tell it by word of mouth, I'd be so
ashamed.
</p>

<p>
I ain't going to pretend I ain't downcasted,
for I be!  I'd fixed my mind on being
snowed in with Undine all winter and setting
in front of the new Franklin stove with our
feet up on the fender and the electric lights
turned on everywheres, for it don't cost no
more to burn ten than one, as you pay by
the year.  I had sold all the cows but one,
thinking Undine wouldn't want me to stay
in the barn too much; parted with the hog,
too, for Undine said they always smell.
Perhaps the hog does, but the ham don't,
and I'll buy another if you think best.
</p>

<p>
I think I'd ought to say that mebbe you
won't take kindly to some of the improvements
yourself, and I don't want to have
'em break on you sudden, which accounts
for this letter.  You'll like having water
brought indoors, and a pump in the kitchen
sink, for it will save you lots of steps.  You'll
be glad of the electrics, because you won't
have to fill lamps and clean chimblies every
morning.  But the color of the house needs
getting used to.  I wanted it gay and bright
for Undine, and by Jiminy, I got it!
</p>

<p>
You see, I bought the paint wholesale,
and when one side of the house was done,
folks could see it from Wareham, and I
wanted to keep it a house and not turn it
into a landmark, so I tried to tone it down.
Well, mother, I bought thirty-seven dollars'
worth of stuff to tone that paint down, and
there warn't no tone-down to it, so as I'd
spent so much on it, I figured it out that I'd
better give up and let time fade it out.  After
all, women-folks live more inside of a house
than outside, and you're always busy in the
back part and don't hear the motors stop
when they pass by, and the people in them
make remarks.
</p>

<p>
I cut down one of the ellums by the gate
just after you left.  I don't know whether
you'll miss it, but it blocked the view of the
schoolhouse and I couldn't see Undine moving
about or working at the blackboard.  I
wish I had it back, for I don't want no closer
view of the teacher they've hired now than I
can get from a good ways off.
</p>

<p>
I've put the dictionary away on the upper
shelf of the china closet where father left it.
I won't say I've given up all idea of marrying
sometime or other, but the girl's got
to have a Bible name next time.  No more
water-sprites for Matt Milliken!
</p>

<p>
Now, mother, without you like Vermont
better'n you do Maine, and Lorenzo and
Lulu better'n you do me, take the next train
for home.  When I get round to it, I shall
know you're worth more'n a dozen Undines,
though I won't deny I feel awful blue, and
never expected to be turned down cold like
I have been by Undine Berry, but I was misled
by her looks, and that's the gospel truth.
I ain't afraid you'll turn me down, mother,
without Lorenzo and Lulu want you to
winter with 'em awful bad, but I hope they
won't, for the neighbors are bound to talk,
and I need you more'n I like to write in a
letter.  It looks kind of foolish, set down in
plain black and white.
</p>

<p>
You can have all the improvements I
made, and welcome; and I guess the greatest
improvement of the whole caboodle will be
the improvement my mother will be on
Undine Berry!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
